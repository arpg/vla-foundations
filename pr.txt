+# About Me
+
+I am a PhD student working on decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on active information gathering and belief-driven planning.
+My research develops principled methods for reasoning over uncertainty to select informative actions that improve downstream decision quality.
+I am particularly interested in applications to autonomous pedestrian navigation, where agents must act safely under partial observability, and to improving weather prediction, where targeted sensing can reduce forecast uncertainty and enable more effective planning.

+
+I am a second year PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder advised by Prof. Alessandro Roncone. 
+My research focuses on embodied AI, specifically in the context of robot learning. 
+I am particularly interested in developing learning-based approaches which go beyond the realm of vision and 
+operate in low data regimes.
+
+In my past life, I was a researcher at Meta AI (Fundamental AI Research) where 
+I worked on projects like [RoboAgent](https://robopen.github.io/), 
+[RT-X or Open X-embodiment](https://rt-x.github.io/), and [OK-Robot](https://ok-robots.github.io/).
+
+These days, I'm working on enabling robots to learn from distributed whole-body sensing, 
+essentially helping robots perceive and understand their peripersonal space using distributed 
+egocentric perception data from whole-body sensors.

+# About Me
+
+I'm a computer science Ph.D. student currently studying strategic information interactions
+in adversarial multiagent systems. At the time of writing, I've recently taken my research
+from Vanderbilt University to CU Boulder to perform interdisciplinary work between
+computer science and aerospace.
+
+## Academic Background
+
+- **University**: University of Colorado Boulder
+- **Major**: Computer Science
+- **Year**: 4th in Ph.D. (first at CU)
+
+## Research Interests
+
+I study multiagent systems - often, but not always, robotic systems. In particular, I'm
+interested in agents with different objectives and environments that are not
+fully observable. Under these circumstances, agents interact in information space: they must
+decide how to manage information to best inform (or deceive) their counterparts. As such, 
+I'm interested in VLAs from the standpoint of using embodied language as a vehicle 
+for strategically conveying information to other agents. 
+
+List your research interests related to:
+- Vision-Language-Action models
+- Robotics
+- Machine Learning
+- Computer Vision
+
+## Projects
+
+Thus far I remain an LLM skeptic and have yet to introduce language modeling into any 
+projects, even for code assistance. We'll see if that changes as I learn more. 
+
+That said, I do have experience with robotics projects. My core multiagent work is mostly 
+simulated, but I've dipped my toes into computer vision (using it for scene
+reconstruction in a surgical robotics project).

+### Important: README Policy for `src/assignments/`
+
+**All READMEs in `src/assignments/` are intentionally minimal.** They contain only:
+1. Link to the canonical assignment page on vlm-robotics.dev
+2. Quick start commands
+3. File list
+
+**Full assignment details (requirements, debugging tips, resources, submission checklists) are maintained exclusively in `content/course/assignments/*.mdx`.** This ensures a single source of truth and prevents documentation drift.

-2. **Create your contributor profile**: `content/contributors/your-github-username.mdx`
-3. **Submit assignments** via pull requests to the `staging` branch
-4. **Wait for CI checks** to pass (GitHub Actions validates MDX syntax and builds)
-5. **Instructor review** and merge
+**IMPORTANT**: All students must follow this workflow for assignment submissions.
 
-### For Instructors
+1. **Create your own branch**:
+   ```bash
+   git checkout -b assignment-name-yourname
+   ```
+   Example: `git checkout -b scratch-1-johndoe`
+
+2. **Make your changes**:

+## Instructor TODO List
+
+**Course Content Completion Tasks**:
+
+- [ ] **Scratch-0 Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/scratch-0.mdx`
+- [ ] **Scratch-1 Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/scratch-1.mdx`
+- [ ] **Paper Audit Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/paper-audit.mdx`
+- [ ] **Capstone Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/capstone.mdx`
+- [ ] **Update /course page**: Link assignments once content is ready (remove "Coming soon" placeholders)
+- [ ] **Syllabus**: Upload current syllabus to Canvas and verify link works
+- [ ] **Textbook Chapters**: Begin writing content for 8 chapters
+- [ ] **Example Paper Audit**: Create sample audit for students to reference
+- [ ] **Setup Branch Protection**: Configure GitHub branch protection rules (students require PRs, instructor can bypass)
+
+**Deployment**:
+- [ ] Test assignment submission workflow end-to-end
+- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline catches common errors
+- [ ] Create assignment grading rubric
+
+**Notes**:
+- Syllabus is currently linked to Canvas: https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/134529/files/82424359/download?download_frd=1
+- Students must submit 1 paper audit (not 4)
+- Capstone tracks: Research or Engineering (no survey track)

+# About Me
+
+I develop algorithms and AI models that enable mobile robots to perceive, predict,
+and act effectively in complex, partially observed, and egocentric environments.
+My work focuses on: multi-modal machine perception for 3D scene understanding, generative occupancy modeling,
+and Vision–Language–Action (VLA) models that unify perception, language, and control for grounded decision-making.

-# Paper Audit: Critical Analysis of VLA Research
+# Assignment: The Technical Paper Audit
 
-## Objective
+**Weight:** 20% (Document) + 10% (Presentation)  
+**Initial Draft Due:** Exactly 7 days prior to your scheduled presentation date.  
+**Mastery Deadline:** Sunday, April 19, 11:59 PM MST.
 
-Develop critical reading skills by deeply analyzing VLA research papers, attempting to reproduce key claims, and documenting findings for the research community.
+## 1. The Philosophy: Audit, Not Summary
 
-## Learning Goals
+In this course, we do not write "summaries." A summary is a transient document that parrots the authors' abstract. An **Audit** is a durable engineering resource intended for the `vlm-robotics.dev` living textbook.
 
-- **Evaluate** research claims against experimental evidence
-- **Reproduce** core results from published papers
-- **Identify** gaps between claims and validation
-- **Communicate** technical findings clearly and rigorously
+As a technical auditor, your job is to pressure-test the paper’s claims from a first-principles perspective. You are looking for the "Information Decay"—the points where the model’s architectural choices sacrifice physical reality for computational ease. If this paper were a technical proposal at an organization like Zoox or Tesla, would you sign off on it? Why or why not?
 
-## Assignment Overview
+## 2. The Mastery Loop (Grading & Feedback)
 
-You will complete **4 paper audits** throughout the semester (one every 2 weeks, 50 points each).
+This assignment utilizes a **Mastery-Based Feedback Loop**. Your grade reflects the technical authority and durability of your documentation.
 
-Each audit requires:
-1. Selecting a VLA paper from the approved list
-2. Reading and understanding the methodology
-3. Attempting to reproduce key claims (code, experiments, or analysis)
-4. Writing a structured critique in Markdown
-5. Submitting via pull request to the course repository
+1.  **The Review Candidate (T-minus 7 Days):** Submit a draft of your MDX document via a Pull Request (PR) to the `staging` branch. 
+2.  **Instructor Review (IR):** I will provide a technical review focusing on mathematical rigor, architectural clarity, and the depth of your critique.
+3.  **The Presentation:** Deliver a "presentationified" version of your audit to the class. 
+4.  **The Improvement Cycle:** You are expected to iterate on your MDX document throughout the semester based on IR and class feedback. 
+    * **Level 1 (C):** A correct summary with basic formatting.
+    * **Level 2 (B):** High technical depth, correct $\LaTeX$, and a sound critique of the model.
+    * **Level 3 (A - Mastery):** "Merge-Ready." The document is of such high quality that it is merged into the `main` branch of the living textbook as a canonical reference.
 
-## Paper Selection
+## 3. Technical Requirements
 
-### Approved Papers
+Your audit must be authored in MDX and include the following sections.
 
-Choose from recent VLA publications in top venues:
+### I. Formal Architecture
+You must formalize the model’s core logic using $\LaTeX$. Do not simply describe the objective; derive it.
+* Define the state-space and the latent transitions.
+* Explicitly detail the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ and any auxiliary objectives (e.g., contrastive or reconstruction losses).
+* **Example:** Define the joint probability for an autoregressive VLA:
+    $$P(a_{1:T} | v_{1:T}, l) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(a_t | v_{\le t}, a_{<t}, l)$$
 
-**Foundational Models:**
-- RT-1: Robotics Transformer for Real-World Control at Scale
-- RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control
-- PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
-- Octo: An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy
+### II. The Instructor Audit Criteria
+Address the following engineering bottlenecks:
+* **Dimensionality & Information Decay:** Where is the bottleneck? Does the projection layer ($v \to z$) discard critical spatial geometry (e.g., depth, texture, or contact physics) needed for the task?
+* **Compute & Inference Reality:** Estimate the FLOPs for a single forward pass. At what frequency (Hz) can this model realistically run on edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Orin or H100)?
+* **The Semantic-Motor Gap:** Identify exactly where the model's "high-level reasoning" (the LLM) fails to ground in "low-level motor primitives" (the policy).
 
-**Data & Training:**
-- Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models
-- DROID: A Large-Scale In-the-Wild Robot Manipulation Dataset
-- BridgeData V2: A Dataset for Robot Learning at Scale
-- Learning Fine-Grained Bimanual Manipulation with Low-Cost Hardware (ALOHA)
+### III. Failure Mode Analysis
+Document the "Obvious Bugs." Identify 2–3 scenarios where the model’s logic is likely to diverge from physical reality (e.g., handling transparent objects, high-velocity dynamic obstacles, or long-horizon causal chains).
 
-**Architectures & Methods:**
-- Perceiver-Actor: A Multi-Task Transformer for Robotic Manipulation
-- Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion
-- 3D Diffuser Actor: Policy Diffusion with 3D Scene Representations
-- VoxPoser: Composable 3D Value Maps for Robotic Manipulation with Language Models
 
-**Evaluation & Deployment:**
-- What Matters in Training a GPT4-Leveraged Hierarchical Robot Policy?
-- On Bringing Robots Home
-- The Challenges of Deploying Reinforcement Learning Agents in the Real World
-- RoboCat: A Self-Improving Foundation Agent for Robotic Manipulation

+
+# Scratch-1: The Transformer Backbone
+
+**Focus**: Implementing the $O(1)$ engine of the VLA stack.
+
+## 1. Objective
+
+In this assignment, you will implement a **decoder-only Transformer from scratch** using PyTorch. You will not use `nn.Transformer` or pre-built `transformers` library backbones. You will build the attention mechanism, the feed-forward blocks, and the autoregressive training loop.
+
+The goal is to train this model to perform **Next-Token Prediction** on a synthetic robotic trajectory dataset.
+
+### The Unified Sequence Hypothesis
+
+This assignment confronts you with the reality of the **Unified Sequence Hypothesis**: that actions, pixels, and words are all just **tokens in an autoregressive chain**. The same architecture that powers GPT-4 can control a robot arm.
+
+## 2. Technical Requirements
+
+### The Architecture
+
+Your implementation must include:
+
+1. **Multi-Head Causal Attention**: Ensuring that token $t$ cannot attend to tokens $t+1, \dots, T$.
+2. **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**: Implementing the relative positional encoding used in modern SOTA models like Llama-3 and PaLM-E.
+3. **RMSNorm**: Utilizing Root Mean Square Layer Normalization for improved training stability.
+
+### The Formalism
+
+Your model will minimize the negative log-likelihood of the sequence $\mathbf{S} = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_T\}$:
+
+$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(s_t | s_{<t}; \theta)$$
+
+Where each $s_t$ represents a tokenized robotic state (position $x, y, z$ and orientation $q$).
+
+## 3. Implementation Tasks
+
+Claude has scaffolded a template in the course repository under `src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py`. You must complete the following blocks:
+
+### Task A: The Causal Self-Attention
+
+Implement the scaled dot-product attention with a causal mask.
+
+$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T + M}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$
+
+Where $M$ is the mask matrix: $M_{ij} = 0$ for $i \ge j$ and $-\infty$ otherwise.
+
+**Key Points**:
+- The mask prevents tokens from attending to future tokens
+- Use `torch.tril` to create the causal mask
+- Apply mask before the softmax operation
+- Handle the multi-head dimension correctly
+
+### Task B: The RMSNorm Block
+
+Implement the normalization layer defined by:
+
+$$\bar{a}_i = \frac{a_i}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j^2 + \epsilon}} \cdot g_i$$
+
+Where:
+- $a_i$ is the input activation
+- $n$ is the dimension
+- $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability (typically $10^{-6}$)
+- $g_i$ is a learned scaling parameter
+
+**Key Points**:
+- RMSNorm is simpler and faster than LayerNorm (no mean subtraction)
+- Used in modern LLMs like Llama-3
+- The scaling parameter $g$ is learned during training
+
+### Task C: The Training Loop
+
+Write a training loop that processes a batch of synthetic trajectories, calculates the cross-entropy loss, and performs backpropagation.
+
+**Requirements**:
+- Process batches of sequences
+- Compute loss using teacher forcing
+- Implement gradient clipping (max norm = 1.0)
+- Log training metrics (loss, perplexity)
+- Save checkpoints every 1000 steps
+
+## 4. Dataset: Synthetic Trajectories
+
+We provide a script `src/assignments/scratch-1/generate_data.py` that creates 10,000 synthetic robot trajectories. Each trajectory consists of a 7-DOF robot arm moving toward a target.
+
+**Dataset Specifications**:
+- **State Space**: 7-DOF joint angles + 3D end-effector position
+- **Action Space**: Discretized into 256 bins per dimension
+- **Sequence Length**: 50 timesteps per trajectory
+- **Vocabulary Size**: 256 tokens
+
+**Data Format**:
+```python
+{
+    'trajectories': torch.Tensor,  # Shape: (10000, 50, 10)
+    'tokenized': torch.LongTensor  # Shape: (10000, 50) - discretized actions
+}
+```
+
+### Generating the Dataset
+
+```bash
+cd src/assignments/scratch-1
+python generate_data.py --output data/trajectories.pkl
+```
+
+## 5. Submission
+
+### Code Submission

+```bash
+git checkout -b scratch-1-yourname
+git add src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py
+git commit -m "Complete Scratch-1: Transformer Backbone"
+git push origin scratch-1-yourname
+```
+
+Open a pull request to the `staging` branch with:
+- Title: `Scratch-1: [Your Name]`
+- Description: Brief summary of your implementation
+

+## 7. Resources
+
+### Attention Mechanism
+- [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (Vaswani et al., 2017)
+- [Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) (Jay Alammar)
+
+### RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)
+- [RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864)
+- [Understanding RoPE](https://blog.eleuther.ai/rotary-embeddings/)
+
+### RMSNorm
+- [Root Mean Square Layer Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467)
+- Used in Llama-3, Grok, and modern LLMs
+
+### PyTorch
+- [PyTorch nn.Module Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_nn/two_layer_net_module.html)
+- [Einops for Tensor Operations](https://einops.rocks/)
+
+## 8. Getting Started
+
+### 1. Generate the Dataset
+
+```bash
+cd src/assignments/scratch-1
+python generate_data.py --num_trajectories 10000 --seq_length 50
+```
+
+### 2. Review the Template
+
+Open `src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py` and locate the `# TODO` markers.
+
+### 3. Implement the Components
+
+Start with RMSNorm (simplest), then move to Attention, then the full model.
+
+### 4. Train the Model
+
+```bash
+python train.py --data data/trajectories.pkl --epochs 10
+```
+
+### 5. Visualize Results
+
+```bash
+python visualize.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt
+```
+
+## 9. Common Pitfalls
+
+### Attention Masking
+- **Mistake**: Applying mask after softmax
+- **Fix**: Mask must be applied before softmax (`logits + mask`)
+
+### RoPE Implementation
+- **Mistake**: Rotating the entire embedding
+- **Fix**: Only rotate pairs of dimensions (see template)
+
+### Training Instability
+- **Mistake**: No gradient clipping
+- **Fix**: Use `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)`
+
+### Memory Issues
+- **Mistake**: Storing entire attention matrix
+- **Fix**: Use efficient attention implementations or smaller batch sizes
+
+## 10. FAQs
+
+**Q: Can I use einops for cleaner tensor operations?**
+A: Yes, but document what each einops operation does.
+
+**Q: Can I use Flash Attention?**
+A: Not for the base implementation. Flash Attention can be used for the Mastery bonus.
+
+**Q: How long should training take?**
+A: On a single GPU: ~10-15 minutes for 10k trajectories. On CPU: ~1 hour.
+
+**Q: What batch size should I use?**
+A: Start with 32. Increase if you have more VRAM.
+
+**Q: My loss isn't converging. Help?**
+A: Check:
+1. Is the causal mask applied correctly?
+2. Is the learning rate too high? (Try 1e-4)
+3. Are gradients exploding? (Enable gradient clipping)
+
+## 11. Deadline
+
+**Due**: Tuesday, January 27, 9:00 AM MST
+
+Late submissions: 10% penalty per day (max 3 days late)
+
+## 12. Office Hours
+
+If you're stuck, attend office hours or post in the discussion forum. Common questions:
+- Debugging attention masks
+- Understanding RoPE rotation matrices
+- Interpreting loss curves
+
+## 13. Collaboration Policy
+
+- **Allowed**: Discussing concepts, debugging together
+- **Not Allowed**: Copying code, sharing implementations
+- **Required**: Document any external resources used (StackOverflow, papers, blog posts)
+
+Good luck! This assignment will give you a deep understanding of how modern VLA models work under the hood.

+### Directory Purpose Guidelines
+
+**`content/`** - Source of truth for all web content
+- Written in MDX (Markdown + JSX)
+- Rendered as web pages on vlm-robotics.dev
+- Instructor writes: textbook chapters, assignment specs, syllabus
+- Students write: contributor profiles, submission reports
+
+**`src/`** - Executable code (Python, etc.)
+- Assignment implementation templates
+- Utility scripts and data generators
+- NOT rendered as web pages
+- READMEs are minimal and point to assignment pages (single source of truth)
+
+**`app/`** - Next.js routing and page components
+- Defines URL structure and page layouts
+- Connects routes to content in `content/`
+- Modified when adding new page types or routes
+
+### Important: README Policy for `src/assignments/`
+
+**All READMEs in `src/assignments/` are intentionally minimal.** They contain only:
+1. Link to the canonical assignment page on vlm-robotics.dev
+2. Quick start commands
+3. File list
+
+**Full assignment details (requirements, debugging tips, resources, submission checklists) are maintained exclusively in `content/course/assignments/*.mdx`.** This ensures a single source of truth and prevents documentation drift.

-2. **Create your contributor profile**: `content/contributors/your-github-username.mdx`
-3. **Submit assignments** via pull requests to the `staging` branch
-4. **Wait for CI checks** to pass (GitHub Actions validates MDX syntax and builds)
-5. **Instructor review** and merge
+**IMPORTANT**: All students must follow this workflow for assignment submissions.
 
-### For Instructors
+1. **Create your own branch**:
+   ```bash
+   git checkout -b assignment-name-yourname
+   ```
+   Example: `git checkout -b scratch-1-johndoe`
+
+2. **Make your changes**:
+   - Add your code to `src/assignments/`
+   - Create your submission report in `content/course/submissions/`
+   - Update your contributor profile if needed
+
+3. **Commit your work**:

+   - Once approved, the instructor will merge to `staging`, then to `main`
+
+**You do NOT have permission to merge your own PRs. All merges are done by the instructor.**
+
+### For the Instructor
 
 1. **Review student PRs** on the `staging` branch
-2. **Merge to `main`** when approved
-3. **Deploy to production** using `./scripts/deploy.sh`

+## Instructor TODO List
+
+**Course Content Completion Tasks**:
+
+- [ ] **Scratch-0 Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/scratch-0.mdx`
+- [ ] **Scratch-1 Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/scratch-1.mdx`
+- [ ] **Paper Audit Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/paper-audit.mdx`
+- [ ] **Capstone Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/capstone.mdx`
+- [ ] **Update /course page**: Link assignments once content is ready (remove "Coming soon" placeholders)
+- [ ] **Syllabus**: Upload current syllabus to Canvas and verify link works
+- [ ] **Textbook Chapters**: Begin writing content for 8 chapters
+- [ ] **Example Paper Audit**: Create sample audit for students to reference
+- [ ] **Setup Branch Protection**: Configure GitHub branch protection rules (students require PRs, instructor can bypass)
+
+**Deployment**:
+- [ ] Test assignment submission workflow end-to-end
+- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline catches common errors
+- [ ] Create assignment grading rubric
+
+**Notes**:
+- Syllabus is currently linked to Canvas: https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/134529/files/82424359/download?download_frd=1
+- Students must submit 1 paper audit (not 4)
+- Capstone tracks: Research or Engineering (no survey track)

-# Paper Audit: Critical Analysis of VLA Research
+# Assignment: The Technical Paper Audit
 
-## Objective
+**Weight:** 20% (Document) + 10% (Presentation)  
+**Initial Draft Due:** Exactly 7 days prior to your scheduled presentation date.  
+**Mastery Deadline:** Sunday, April 19, 11:59 PM MST.
 
-Develop critical reading skills by deeply analyzing VLA research papers, attempting to reproduce key claims, and documenting findings for the research community.
+## 1. The Philosophy: Audit, Not Summary
 
-## Learning Goals
+In this course, we do not write "summaries." A summary is a transient document that parrots the authors' abstract. An **Audit** is a durable engineering resource intended for the `vlm-robotics.dev` living textbook.
 
-- **Evaluate** research claims against experimental evidence
-- **Reproduce** core results from published papers
-- **Identify** gaps between claims and validation
-- **Communicate** technical findings clearly and rigorously
+As a technical auditor, your job is to pressure-test the paper’s claims from a first-principles perspective. You are looking for the "Information Decay"—the points where the model’s architectural choices sacrifice physical reality for computational ease. If this paper were a technical proposal at an organization like Zoox or Tesla, would you sign off on it? Why or why not?
 
-## Assignment Overview
+## 2. The Mastery Loop (Grading & Feedback)
 
-You will complete **4 paper audits** throughout the semester (one every 2 weeks, 50 points each).
+This assignment utilizes a **Mastery-Based Feedback Loop**. Your grade reflects the technical authority and durability of your documentation.
 
-Each audit requires:
-1. Selecting a VLA paper from the approved list
-2. Reading and understanding the methodology
-3. Attempting to reproduce key claims (code, experiments, or analysis)
-4. Writing a structured critique in Markdown
-5. Submitting via pull request to the course repository
+1.  **The Review Candidate (T-minus 7 Days):** Submit a draft of your MDX document via a Pull Request (PR) to the `staging` branch. 
+2.  **Instructor Review (IR):** I will provide a technical review focusing on mathematical rigor, architectural clarity, and the depth of your critique.
+3.  **The Presentation:** Deliver a "presentationified" version of your audit to the class. 
+4.  **The Improvement Cycle:** You are expected to iterate on your MDX document throughout the semester based on IR and class feedback. 
+    * **Level 1 (C):** A correct summary with basic formatting.
+    * **Level 2 (B):** High technical depth, correct $\LaTeX$, and a sound critique of the model.
+    * **Level 3 (A - Mastery):** "Merge-Ready." The document is of such high quality that it is merged into the `main` branch of the living textbook as a canonical reference.
 
-## Paper Selection
+## 3. Technical Requirements
 
-### Approved Papers
+Your audit must be authored in MDX and include the following sections.
 
-Choose from recent VLA publications in top venues:
+### I. Formal Architecture
+You must formalize the model’s core logic using $\LaTeX$. Do not simply describe the objective; derive it.
+* Define the state-space and the latent transitions.
+* Explicitly detail the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ and any auxiliary objectives (e.g., contrastive or reconstruction losses).
+* **Example:** Define the joint probability for an autoregressive VLA:
+    $$P(a_{1:T} | v_{1:T}, l) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(a_t | v_{\le t}, a_{<t}, l)$$
 
-**Foundational Models:**
-- RT-1: Robotics Transformer for Real-World Control at Scale
-- RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control
-- PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
-- Octo: An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy
+### II. The Instructor Audit Criteria
+Address the following engineering bottlenecks:
+* **Dimensionality & Information Decay:** Where is the bottleneck? Does the projection layer ($v \to z$) discard critical spatial geometry (e.g., depth, texture, or contact physics) needed for the task?
+* **Compute & Inference Reality:** Estimate the FLOPs for a single forward pass. At what frequency (Hz) can this model realistically run on edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Orin or H100)?
+* **The Semantic-Motor Gap:** Identify exactly where the model's "high-level reasoning" (the LLM) fails to ground in "low-level motor primitives" (the policy).
 
-**Data & Training:**
-- Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models
-- DROID: A Large-Scale In-the-Wild Robot Manipulation Dataset
-- BridgeData V2: A Dataset for Robot Learning at Scale
-- Learning Fine-Grained Bimanual Manipulation with Low-Cost Hardware (ALOHA)
+### III. Failure Mode Analysis
+Document the "Obvious Bugs." Identify 2–3 scenarios where the model’s logic is likely to diverge from physical reality (e.g., handling transparent objects, high-velocity dynamic obstacles, or long-horizon causal chains).
 
-**Architectures & Methods:**
-- Perceiver-Actor: A Multi-Task Transformer for Robotic Manipulation
-- Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion
-- 3D Diffuser Actor: Policy Diffusion with 3D Scene Representations
-- VoxPoser: Composable 3D Value Maps for Robotic Manipulation with Language Models
 
-**Evaluation & Deployment:**
-- What Matters in Training a GPT4-Leveraged Hierarchical Robot Policy?
-- On Bringing Robots Home
-- The Challenges of Deploying Reinforcement Learning Agents in the Real World
-- RoboCat: A Self-Improving Foundation Agent for Robotic Manipulation
 
-**Custom Selection:**
-If you want to audit a paper not on this list, get instructor approval first.

+
+# Scratch-1: The Transformer Backbone
+
+**Focus**: Implementing the $O(1)$ engine of the VLA stack.
+
+## 1. Objective
+
+In this assignment, you will implement a **decoder-only Transformer from scratch** using PyTorch. You will not use `nn.Transformer` or pre-built `transformers` library backbones. You will build the attention mechanism, the feed-forward blocks, and the autoregressive training loop.
+
+The goal is to train this model to perform **Next-Token Prediction** on a synthetic robotic trajectory dataset.
+
+### The Unified Sequence Hypothesis
+
+This assignment confronts you with the reality of the **Unified Sequence Hypothesis**: that actions, pixels, and words are all just **tokens in an autoregressive chain**. The same architecture that powers GPT-4 can control a robot arm.
+
+## 2. Technical Requirements
+
+### The Architecture
+
+Your implementation must include:
+
+1. **Multi-Head Causal Attention**: Ensuring that token $t$ cannot attend to tokens $t+1, \dots, T$.
+2. **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**: Implementing the relative positional encoding used in modern SOTA models like Llama-3 and PaLM-E.
+3. **RMSNorm**: Utilizing Root Mean Square Layer Normalization for improved training stability.
+
+### The Formalism
+
+Your model will minimize the negative log-likelihood of the sequence $\mathbf{S} = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_T\}$:
+
+$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(s_t | s_{<t}; \theta)$$
+
+Where each $s_t$ represents a tokenized robotic state (position $x, y, z$ and orientation $q$).
+
+## 3. Implementation Tasks
+
+Claude has scaffolded a template in the course repository under `src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py`. You must complete the following blocks:
+
+### Task A: The Causal Self-Attention
+
+Implement the scaled dot-product attention with a causal mask.
+
+$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T + M}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$
+
+Where $M$ is the mask matrix: $M_{ij} = 0$ for $i \ge j$ and $-\infty$ otherwise.
+
+**Key Points**:
+- The mask prevents tokens from attending to future tokens
+- Use `torch.tril` to create the causal mask
+- Apply mask before the softmax operation
+- Handle the multi-head dimension correctly
+
+### Task B: The RMSNorm Block
+
+Implement the normalization layer defined by:
+
+$$\bar{a}_i = \frac{a_i}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j^2 + \epsilon}} \cdot g_i$$
+
+Where:
+- $a_i$ is the input activation
+- $n$ is the dimension
+- $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability (typically $10^{-6}$)
+- $g_i$ is a learned scaling parameter
+
+**Key Points**:
+- RMSNorm is simpler and faster than LayerNorm (no mean subtraction)
+- Used in modern LLMs like Llama-3
+- The scaling parameter $g$ is learned during training
+
+### Task C: The Training Loop
+
+Write a training loop that processes a batch of synthetic trajectories, calculates the cross-entropy loss, and performs backpropagation.
+
+**Requirements**:
+- Process batches of sequences
+- Compute loss using teacher forcing
+- Implement gradient clipping (max norm = 1.0)
+- Log training metrics (loss, perplexity)
+- Save checkpoints every 1000 steps
+
+## 4. Dataset: Synthetic Trajectories
+
+We provide a script `src/assignments/scratch-1/generate_data.py` that creates 10,000 synthetic robot trajectories. Each trajectory consists of a 7-DOF robot arm moving toward a target.
+
+**Dataset Specifications**:
+- **State Space**: 7-DOF joint angles + 3D end-effector position
+- **Action Space**: Discretized into 256 bins per dimension
+- **Sequence Length**: 50 timesteps per trajectory
+- **Vocabulary Size**: 256 tokens
+
+**Data Format**:
+```python
+{
+    'trajectories': torch.Tensor,  # Shape: (10000, 50, 10)
+    'tokenized': torch.LongTensor  # Shape: (10000, 50) - discretized actions
+}
+```
+
+### Generating the Dataset
+
+```bash
+cd src/assignments/scratch-1
+python generate_data.py --output data/trajectories.pkl
+```
+
+## 5. Submission
+
+### Code Submission
+
+Commit your implementation to your student branch in the `arpg/vla-foundations` repo:
+
+```bash
+git checkout -b scratch-1-yourname
+git add src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py
+git commit -m "Complete Scratch-1: Transformer Backbone"
+git push origin scratch-1-yourname
+```
+
+Open a pull request to the `staging` branch with:
+- Title: `Scratch-1: [Your Name]`
+- Description: Brief summary of your implementation
+
+### Report Submission
+
+Create an MDX page at `content/course/submissions/scratch-1/[your-name].mdx` with the following sections:
+
+#### Required Content
+
+1. **Loss Curve**: Plot training loss over iterations

+
+## 8. Getting Started
+
+### 1. Generate the Dataset
+
+```bash
+cd src/assignments/scratch-1
+python generate_data.py --num_trajectories 10000 --seq_length 50
+```
+
+### 2. Review the Template
+
+Open `src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py` and locate the `# TODO` markers.
+
+### 3. Implement the Components
+
+Start with RMSNorm (simplest), then move to Attention, then the full model.
+
+### 4. Train the Model
+
+```bash
+python train.py --data data/trajectories.pkl --epochs 10
+```
+
+### 5. Visualize Results
+
+```bash
+python visualize.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt
+```
+
+## 9. Common Pitfalls
+
+### Attention Masking
+- **Mistake**: Applying mask after softmax
+- **Fix**: Mask must be applied before softmax (`logits + mask`)
+
+### RoPE Implementation
+- **Mistake**: Rotating the entire embedding
+- **Fix**: Only rotate pairs of dimensions (see template)
+
+### Training Instability
+- **Mistake**: No gradient clipping
+- **Fix**: Use `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)`
+
+### Memory Issues
+- **Mistake**: Storing entire attention matrix
+- **Fix**: Use efficient attention implementations or smaller batch sizes
+
+## 10. FAQs
+
+**Q: Can I use einops for cleaner tensor operations?**
+A: Yes, but document what each einops operation does.
+
+**Q: Can I use Flash Attention?**
+A: Not for the base implementation. Flash Attention can be used for the Mastery bonus.
+
+**Q: How long should training take?**
+A: On a single GPU: ~10-15 minutes for 10k trajectories. On CPU: ~1 hour.
+
+**Q: What batch size should I use?**
+A: Start with 32. Increase if you have more VRAM.
+
+**Q: My loss isn't converging. Help?**
+A: Check:
+1. Is the causal mask applied correctly?
+2. Is the learning rate too high? (Try 1e-4)
+3. Are gradients exploding? (Enable gradient clipping)
+
+## 11. Deadline
+
+**Due**: Tuesday, January 27, 9:00 AM MST
+
+Late submissions: 10% penalty per day (max 3 days late)

+### Directory Purpose Guidelines
+
+**`content/`** - Source of truth for all web content
+- Written in MDX (Markdown + JSX)
+- Rendered as web pages on vlm-robotics.dev
+- Instructor writes: textbook chapters, assignment specs, syllabus
+- Students write: contributor profiles, submission reports
+
+**`src/`** - Executable code (Python, etc.)
+- Assignment implementation templates
+- Utility scripts and data generators
+- NOT rendered as web pages
+- READMEs are minimal and point to assignment pages (single source of truth)
+
+**`app/`** - Next.js routing and page components
+- Defines URL structure and page layouts
+- Connects routes to content in `content/`
+- Modified when adding new page types or routes
+
+### Important: README Policy for `src/assignments/`
+
+**All READMEs in `src/assignments/` are intentionally minimal.** They contain only:
+1. Link to the canonical assignment page on vlm-robotics.dev
+2. Quick start commands
+3. File list
+
+**Full assignment details (requirements, debugging tips, resources, submission checklists) are maintained exclusively in `content/course/assignments/*.mdx`.** This ensures a single source of truth and prevents documentation drift.

+# About Me
+
+I am a 2018 CU Boulder Alum with undergraduate degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science. I've been working in the robotics industry the last 7 years. I currently work for Lunar Outpost as a Senior Robotics Engineer. I'm currently pursing a PhD in the (newly formed) Robotics Program. I decided to come back to school because I've implemented multiple robotic systems that are capable up to 90% of the time and I want to solve the remaining 10% effectively. When I'm not working, doing school work, or TAing, you can find me at live music events, doing yoga, or playing hockey.

-# Paper Audit: Critical Analysis of VLA Research
+# Assignment: The Technical Paper Audit
 
-## Objective
+**Weight:** 20% (Document) + 10% (Presentation)  
+**Initial Draft Due:** Exactly 7 days prior to your scheduled presentation date.  
+**Mastery Deadline:** Sunday, April 19, 11:59 PM MST.
 
-Develop critical reading skills by deeply analyzing VLA research papers, attempting to reproduce key claims, and documenting findings for the research community.
+## 1. The Philosophy: Audit, Not Summary
 
-## Learning Goals
+In this course, we do not write "summaries." A summary is a transient document that parrots the authors' abstract. An **Audit** is a durable engineering resource intended for the `vlm-robotics.dev` living textbook.
 
-- **Evaluate** research claims against experimental evidence
-- **Reproduce** core results from published papers
-- **Identify** gaps between claims and validation
-- **Communicate** technical findings clearly and rigorously
+As a technical auditor, your job is to pressure-test the paper’s claims from a first-principles perspective. You are looking for the "Information Decay"—the points where the model’s architectural choices sacrifice physical reality for computational ease. If this paper were a technical proposal at an organization like Zoox or Tesla, would you sign off on it? Why or why not?
 
-## Assignment Overview
+## 2. The Mastery Loop (Grading & Feedback)
 
-You will complete **4 paper audits** throughout the semester (one every 2 weeks, 50 points each).
+This assignment utilizes a **Mastery-Based Feedback Loop**. Your grade reflects the technical authority and durability of your documentation.
 
-Each audit requires:
-1. Selecting a VLA paper from the approved list
-2. Reading and understanding the methodology
-3. Attempting to reproduce key claims (code, experiments, or analysis)
-4. Writing a structured critique in Markdown
-5. Submitting via pull request to the course repository
+1.  **The Review Candidate (T-minus 7 Days):** Submit a draft of your MDX document via a Pull Request (PR) to the `staging` branch. 
+2.  **Instructor Review (IR):** I will provide a technical review focusing on mathematical rigor, architectural clarity, and the depth of your critique.
+3.  **The Presentation:** Deliver a "presentationified" version of your audit to the class. 
+4.  **The Improvement Cycle:** You are expected to iterate on your MDX document throughout the semester based on IR and class feedback. 
+    * **Level 1 (C):** A correct summary with basic formatting.
+    * **Level 2 (B):** High technical depth, correct $\LaTeX$, and a sound critique of the model.
+    * **Level 3 (A - Mastery):** "Merge-Ready." The document is of such high quality that it is merged into the `main` branch of the living textbook as a canonical reference.
 
-## Paper Selection
+## 3. Technical Requirements
 
-### Approved Papers
+Your audit must be authored in MDX and include the following sections.
 
-Choose from recent VLA publications in top venues:
+### I. Formal Architecture
+You must formalize the model’s core logic using $\LaTeX$. Do not simply describe the objective; derive it.
+* Define the state-space and the latent transitions.
+* Explicitly detail the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ and any auxiliary objectives (e.g., contrastive or reconstruction losses).
+* **Example:** Define the joint probability for an autoregressive VLA:
+    $$P(a_{1:T} | v_{1:T}, l) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(a_t | v_{\le t}, a_{<t}, l)$$
 
-**Foundational Models:**
-- RT-1: Robotics Transformer for Real-World Control at Scale
-- RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control
-- PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
-- Octo: An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy
+### II. The Instructor Audit Criteria
+Address the following engineering bottlenecks:
+* **Dimensionality & Information Decay:** Where is the bottleneck? Does the projection layer ($v \to z$) discard critical spatial geometry (e.g., depth, texture, or contact physics) needed for the task?
+* **Compute & Inference Reality:** Estimate the FLOPs for a single forward pass. At what frequency (Hz) can this model realistically run on edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Orin or H100)?
+* **The Semantic-Motor Gap:** Identify exactly where the model's "high-level reasoning" (the LLM) fails to ground in "low-level motor primitives" (the policy).
 
-**Data & Training:**
-- Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models
-- DROID: A Large-Scale In-the-Wild Robot Manipulation Dataset
-- BridgeData V2: A Dataset for Robot Learning at Scale
-- Learning Fine-Grained Bimanual Manipulation with Low-Cost Hardware (ALOHA)
+### III. Failure Mode Analysis

+
+# Scratch-1: The Transformer Backbone
+
+**Focus**: Implementing the $O(1)$ engine of the VLA stack.
+
+## 1. Objective
+
+In this assignment, you will implement a **decoder-only Transformer from scratch** using PyTorch. You will not use `nn.Transformer` or pre-built `transformers` library backbones. You will build the attention mechanism, the feed-forward blocks, and the autoregressive training loop.
+
+The goal is to train this model to perform **Next-Token Prediction** on a synthetic robotic trajectory dataset.
+
+### The Unified Sequence Hypothesis
+
+This assignment confronts you with the reality of the **Unified Sequence Hypothesis**: that actions, pixels, and words are all just **tokens in an autoregressive chain**. The same architecture that powers GPT-4 can control a robot arm.
+
+## 2. Technical Requirements
+
+### The Architecture
+
+Your implementation must include:
+
+1. **Multi-Head Causal Attention**: Ensuring that token $t$ cannot attend to tokens $t+1, \dots, T$.
+2. **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**: Implementing the relative positional encoding used in modern SOTA models like Llama-3 and PaLM-E.
+3. **RMSNorm**: Utilizing Root Mean Square Layer Normalization for improved training stability.
+
+### The Formalism
+
+Your model will minimize the negative log-likelihood of the sequence $\mathbf{S} = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_T\}$:
+
+$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(s_t | s_{<t}; \theta)$$
+
+Where each $s_t$ represents a tokenized robotic state (position $x, y, z$ and orientation $q$).
+
+## 3. Implementation Tasks
+
+Claude has scaffolded a template in the course repository under `src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py`. You must complete the following blocks:
+
+### Task A: The Causal Self-Attention
+
+Implement the scaled dot-product attention with a causal mask.
+
+$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T + M}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$
+
+Where $M$ is the mask matrix: $M_{ij} = 0$ for $i \ge j$ and $-\infty$ otherwise.
+
+**Key Points**:
+- The mask prevents tokens from attending to future tokens
+- Use `torch.tril` to create the causal mask
+- Apply mask before the softmax operation
+- Handle the multi-head dimension correctly
+
+### Task B: The RMSNorm Block
+
+Implement the normalization layer defined by:
+
+$$\bar{a}_i = \frac{a_i}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j^2 + \epsilon}} \cdot g_i$$
+
+Where:
+- $a_i$ is the input activation
+- $n$ is the dimension
+- $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability (typically $10^{-6}$)
+- $g_i$ is a learned scaling parameter
+
+**Key Points**:
+- RMSNorm is simpler and faster than LayerNorm (no mean subtraction)
+- Used in modern LLMs like Llama-3
+- The scaling parameter $g$ is learned during training
+
+### Task C: The Training Loop
+
+Write a training loop that processes a batch of synthetic trajectories, calculates the cross-entropy loss, and performs backpropagation.
+
+**Requirements**:
+- Process batches of sequences
+- Compute loss using teacher forcing
+- Implement gradient clipping (max norm = 1.0)
+- Log training metrics (loss, perplexity)
+- Save checkpoints every 1000 steps
+
+## 4. Dataset: Synthetic Trajectories
+
+We provide a script `src/assignments/scratch-1/generate_data.py` that creates 10,000 synthetic robot trajectories. Each trajectory consists of a 7-DOF robot arm moving toward a target.
+
+**Dataset Specifications**:
+- **State Space**: 7-DOF joint angles + 3D end-effector position
+- **Action Space**: Discretized into 256 bins per dimension
+- **Sequence Length**: 50 timesteps per trajectory
+- **Vocabulary Size**: 256 tokens
+
+**Data Format**:
+```python
+{
+    'trajectories': torch.Tensor,  # Shape: (10000, 50, 10)
+    'tokenized': torch.LongTensor  # Shape: (10000, 50) - discretized actions
+}
+```
+
+### Generating the Dataset
+
+```bash
+cd src/assignments/scratch-1
+python generate_data.py --output data/trajectories.pkl
+```
+
+## 5. Submission
+
+### Code Submission

+```bash
+git checkout -b scratch-1-yourname
+git add src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py
+git commit -m "Complete Scratch-1: Transformer Backbone"
+git push origin scratch-1-yourname
+```
+
+Open a pull request to the `staging` branch with:
+- Title: `Scratch-1: [Your Name]`
+- Description: Brief summary of your implementation
+
+### Report Submission

+- [RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864)
+- [Understanding RoPE](https://blog.eleuther.ai/rotary-embeddings/)
+
+### RMSNorm
+- [Root Mean Square Layer Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467)
+- Used in Llama-3, Grok, and modern LLMs
+
+### PyTorch
+- [PyTorch nn.Module Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_nn/two_layer_net_module.html)
+- [Einops for Tensor Operations](https://einops.rocks/)
+
+## 8. Getting Started
+
+### 1. Generate the Dataset
+
+```bash
+cd src/assignments/scratch-1
+python generate_data.py --num_trajectories 10000 --seq_length 50
+```
+
+### 2. Review the Template
+
+Open `src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py` and locate the `# TODO` markers.
+
+### 3. Implement the Components
+
+Start with RMSNorm (simplest), then move to Attention, then the full model.
+
+### 4. Train the Model
+
+```bash
+python train.py --data data/trajectories.pkl --epochs 10
+```
+
+### 5. Visualize Results
+
+```bash
+python visualize.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt
+```
+
+## 9. Common Pitfalls
+
+### Attention Masking
+- **Mistake**: Applying mask after softmax
+- **Fix**: Mask must be applied before softmax (`logits + mask`)
+
+### RoPE Implementation
+- **Mistake**: Rotating the entire embedding
+- **Fix**: Only rotate pairs of dimensions (see template)
+
+### Training Instability
+- **Mistake**: No gradient clipping
+- **Fix**: Use `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)`
+
+### Memory Issues
+- **Mistake**: Storing entire attention matrix
+- **Fix**: Use efficient attention implementations or smaller batch sizes
+
+## 10. FAQs
+
+**Q: Can I use einops for cleaner tensor operations?**
+A: Yes, but document what each einops operation does.
+
+**Q: Can I use Flash Attention?**
+A: Not for the base implementation. Flash Attention can be used for the Mastery bonus.
+
+**Q: How long should training take?**
+A: On a single GPU: ~10-15 minutes for 10k trajectories. On CPU: ~1 hour.
+
+**Q: What batch size should I use?**
+A: Start with 32. Increase if you have more VRAM.
+
+**Q: My loss isn't converging. Help?**
+A: Check:
+1. Is the causal mask applied correctly?
+2. Is the learning rate too high? (Try 1e-4)
+3. Are gradients exploding? (Enable gradient clipping)
+
+## 11. Deadline
+
+**Due**: Tuesday, January 27, 9:00 AM MST
+
+Late submissions: 10% penalty per day (max 3 days late)
+
+## 12. Office Hours
+
+If you're stuck, attend office hours or post in the discussion forum. Common questions:
+- Debugging attention masks
+- Understanding RoPE rotation matrices
+- Interpreting loss curves
+
+## 13. Collaboration Policy
+
+- **Allowed**: Discussing concepts, debugging together
+- **Not Allowed**: Copying code, sharing implementations
+- **Required**: Document any external resources used (StackOverflow, papers, blog posts)
+
+Good luck! This assignment will give you a deep understanding of how modern VLA models work under the hood.

+### Directory Purpose Guidelines
+
+**`content/`** - Source of truth for all web content
+- Written in MDX (Markdown + JSX)
+- Rendered as web pages on vlm-robotics.dev
+- Instructor writes: textbook chapters, assignment specs, syllabus
+- Students write: contributor profiles, submission reports
+
+**`src/`** - Executable code (Python, etc.)
+- Assignment implementation templates
+- Utility scripts and data generators
+- NOT rendered as web pages
+- READMEs are minimal and point to assignment pages (single source of truth)
+
+**`app/`** - Next.js routing and page components
+- Defines URL structure and page layouts
+- Connects routes to content in `content/`
+- Modified when adding new page types or routes
+
+### Important: README Policy for `src/assignments/`
+
+**All READMEs in `src/assignments/` are intentionally minimal.** They contain only:
+1. Link to the canonical assignment page on vlm-robotics.dev
+2. Quick start commands
+3. File list
+
+**Full assignment details (requirements, debugging tips, resources, submission checklists) are maintained exclusively in `content/course/assignments/*.mdx`.** This ensures a single source of truth and prevents documentation drift.

 ### For Students
 
-1. **Fork the repository** (or create a branch if you have write access)
-2. **Create your contributor profile**: `content/contributors/your-github-username.mdx`
-3. **Submit assignments** via pull requests to the `staging` branch
-4. **Wait for CI checks** to pass (GitHub Actions validates MDX syntax and builds)
-5. **Instructor review** and merge
+**IMPORTANT**: All students must follow this workflow for assignment submissions.
 
-### For Instructors
+1. **Create your own branch**:
+   ```bash
+   git checkout -b assignment-name-yourname
+   ```
+   Example: `git checkout -b scratch-1-johndoe`
+
+2. **Make your changes**:
+   - Add your code to `src/assignments/`
+   - Create your submission report in `content/course/submissions/`
+   - Update your contributor profile if needed
+
+3. **Commit your work**:
+   ```bash
+   git add .
+   git commit -m "Complete Assignment X: Your Name"
+   git push origin assignment-name-yourname

+
+5. **Wait for CI checks** to pass (GitHub Actions will validate your submission)
+
+6. **Wait for instructor review**:
+   - **ONLY the instructor can merge pull requests**
+   - The instructor will review your code and report
+   - You may be asked to make changes
+   - Once approved, the instructor will merge to `staging`, then to `main`
+
+**You do NOT have permission to merge your own PRs. All merges are done by the instructor.**
+
+### For the Instructor
 
 1. **Review student PRs** on the `staging` branch
-2. **Merge to `main`** when approved
-3. **Deploy to production** using `./scripts/deploy.sh`
+2. **Provide feedback** and request changes if needed
+3. **Merge to `staging`** when approved

+## Instructor TODO List
+
+**Course Content Completion Tasks**:
+
+- [ ] **Scratch-0 Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/scratch-0.mdx`
+- [ ] **Scratch-1 Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/scratch-1.mdx`
+- [ ] **Paper Audit Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/paper-audit.mdx`
+- [ ] **Capstone Assignment**: Create full assignment specification in `content/course/assignments/capstone.mdx`
+- [ ] **Update /course page**: Link assignments once content is ready (remove "Coming soon" placeholders)
+- [ ] **Syllabus**: Upload current syllabus to Canvas and verify link works
+- [ ] **Textbook Chapters**: Begin writing content for 8 chapters
+- [ ] **Example Paper Audit**: Create sample audit for students to reference
+- [ ] **Setup Branch Protection**: Configure GitHub branch protection rules (students require PRs, instructor can bypass)
+
+**Deployment**:
+- [ ] Test assignment submission workflow end-to-end
+- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline catches common errors
+- [ ] Create assignment grading rubric
+
+**Notes**:
+- Syllabus is currently linked to Canvas: https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/134529/files/82424359/download?download_frd=1
+- Students must submit 1 paper audit (not 4)
+- Capstone tracks: Research or Engineering (no survey track)

-# Paper Audit: Critical Analysis of VLA Research
+# Assignment: The Technical Paper Audit
 
-## Objective
+**Weight:** 20% (Document) + 10% (Presentation)  
+**Initial Draft Due:** Exactly 7 days prior to your scheduled presentation date.  
+**Mastery Deadline:** Sunday, April 19, 11:59 PM MST.
 
-Develop critical reading skills by deeply analyzing VLA research papers, attempting to reproduce key claims, and documenting findings for the research community.
+## 1. The Philosophy: Audit, Not Summary
 
-## Learning Goals
+In this course, we do not write "summaries." A summary is a transient document that parrots the authors' abstract. An **Audit** is a durable engineering resource intended for the `vlm-robotics.dev` living textbook.
 
-- **Evaluate** research claims against experimental evidence
-- **Reproduce** core results from published papers
-- **Identify** gaps between claims and validation
-- **Communicate** technical findings clearly and rigorously
+As a technical auditor, your job is to pressure-test the paper’s claims from a first-principles perspective. You are looking for the "Information Decay"—the points where the model’s architectural choices sacrifice physical reality for computational ease. If this paper were a technical proposal at an organization like Zoox or Tesla, would you sign off on it? Why or why not?
 
-## Assignment Overview
+## 2. The Mastery Loop (Grading & Feedback)
 
-You will complete **4 paper audits** throughout the semester (one every 2 weeks, 50 points each).
+This assignment utilizes a **Mastery-Based Feedback Loop**. Your grade reflects the technical authority and durability of your documentation.
 
-Each audit requires:
-1. Selecting a VLA paper from the approved list
-2. Reading and understanding the methodology
-3. Attempting to reproduce key claims (code, experiments, or analysis)
-4. Writing a structured critique in Markdown
-5. Submitting via pull request to the course repository
+1.  **The Review Candidate (T-minus 7 Days):** Submit a draft of your MDX document via a Pull Request (PR) to the `staging` branch. 
+2.  **Instructor Review (IR):** I will provide a technical review focusing on mathematical rigor, architectural clarity, and the depth of your critique.
+3.  **The Presentation:** Deliver a "presentationified" version of your audit to the class. 
+4.  **The Improvement Cycle:** You are expected to iterate on your MDX document throughout the semester based on IR and class feedback. 
+    * **Level 1 (C):** A correct summary with basic formatting.
+    * **Level 2 (B):** High technical depth, correct $\LaTeX$, and a sound critique of the model.
+    * **Level 3 (A - Mastery):** "Merge-Ready." The document is of such high quality that it is merged into the `main` branch of the living textbook as a canonical reference.
 
-## Paper Selection
+## 3. Technical Requirements
 
-### Approved Papers
+Your audit must be authored in MDX and include the following sections.
 
-Choose from recent VLA publications in top venues:
+### I. Formal Architecture
+You must formalize the model’s core logic using $\LaTeX$. Do not simply describe the objective; derive it.
+* Define the state-space and the latent transitions.
+* Explicitly detail the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ and any auxiliary objectives (e.g., contrastive or reconstruction losses).
+* **Example:** Define the joint probability for an autoregressive VLA:
+    $$P(a_{1:T} | v_{1:T}, l) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(a_t | v_{\le t}, a_{<t}, l)$$
 
-**Foundational Models:**
-- RT-1: Robotics Transformer for Real-World Control at Scale
-- RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control
-- PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
-- Octo: An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy
+### II. The Instructor Audit Criteria
+Address the following engineering bottlenecks:
+* **Dimensionality & Information Decay:** Where is the bottleneck? Does the projection layer ($v \to z$) discard critical spatial geometry (e.g., depth, texture, or contact physics) needed for the task?
+* **Compute & Inference Reality:** Estimate the FLOPs for a single forward pass. At what frequency (Hz) can this model realistically run on edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Orin or H100)?
+* **The Semantic-Motor Gap:** Identify exactly where the model's "high-level reasoning" (the LLM) fails to ground in "low-level motor primitives" (the policy).
 
-**Data & Training:**
-- Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models
-- DROID: A Large-Scale In-the-Wild Robot Manipulation Dataset
-- BridgeData V2: A Dataset for Robot Learning at Scale
-- Learning Fine-Grained Bimanual Manipulation with Low-Cost Hardware (ALOHA)
+### III. Failure Mode Analysis
+Document the "Obvious Bugs." Identify 2–3 scenarios where the model’s logic is likely to diverge from physical reality (e.g., handling transparent objects, high-velocity dynamic obstacles, or long-horizon causal chains).
 
-**Architectures & Methods:**
-- Perceiver-Actor: A Multi-Task Transformer for Robotic Manipulation
-- Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion
-- 3D Diffuser Actor: Policy Diffusion with 3D Scene Representations
-- VoxPoser: Composable 3D Value Maps for Robotic Manipulation with Language Models
 
-**Evaluation & Deployment:**
-- What Matters in Training a GPT4-Leveraged Hierarchical Robot Policy?
-- On Bringing Robots Home
-- The Challenges of Deploying Reinforcement Learning Agents in the Real World
-- RoboCat: A Self-Improving Foundation Agent for Robotic Manipulation
 
-**Custom Selection:**
-If you want to audit a paper not on this list, get instructor approval first.

+
+# Scratch-1: The Transformer Backbone
+
+**Focus**: Implementing the $O(1)$ engine of the VLA stack.
+
+## 1. Objective
+
+In this assignment, you will implement a **decoder-only Transformer from scratch** using PyTorch. You will not use `nn.Transformer` or pre-built `transformers` library backbones. You will build the attention mechanism, the feed-forward blocks, and the autoregressive training loop.
+
+The goal is to train this model to perform **Next-Token Prediction** on a synthetic robotic trajectory dataset.
+
+### The Unified Sequence Hypothesis
+
+This assignment confronts you with the reality of the **Unified Sequence Hypothesis**: that actions, pixels, and words are all just **tokens in an autoregressive chain**. The same architecture that powers GPT-4 can control a robot arm.
+
+## 2. Technical Requirements
+
+### The Architecture
+
+Your implementation must include:
+
+1. **Multi-Head Causal Attention**: Ensuring that token $t$ cannot attend to tokens $t+1, \dots, T$.
+2. **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**: Implementing the relative positional encoding used in modern SOTA models like Llama-3 and PaLM-E.
+3. **RMSNorm**: Utilizing Root Mean Square Layer Normalization for improved training stability.
+
+### The Formalism
+
+Your model will minimize the negative log-likelihood of the sequence $\mathbf{S} = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_T\}$:
+
+$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(s_t | s_{<t}; \theta)$$
+
+Where each $s_t$ represents a tokenized robotic state (position $x, y, z$ and orientation $q$).
+
+## 3. Implementation Tasks
+
+Claude has scaffolded a template in the course repository under `src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py`. You must complete the following blocks:
+
+### Task A: The Causal Self-Attention
+
+Implement the scaled dot-product attention with a causal mask.
+
+$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T + M}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$
+
+Where $M$ is the mask matrix: $M_{ij} = 0$ for $i \ge j$ and $-\infty$ otherwise.
+
+**Key Points**:
+- The mask prevents tokens from attending to future tokens
+- Use `torch.tril` to create the causal mask
+- Apply mask before the softmax operation
+- Handle the multi-head dimension correctly
+
+### Task B: The RMSNorm Block
+
+Implement the normalization layer defined by:
+
+$$\bar{a}_i = \frac{a_i}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j^2 + \epsilon}} \cdot g_i$$
+
+Where:
+- $a_i$ is the input activation
+- $n$ is the dimension
+- $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability (typically $10^{-6}$)
+- $g_i$ is a learned scaling parameter
+
+**Key Points**:
+- RMSNorm is simpler and faster than LayerNorm (no mean subtraction)
+- Used in modern LLMs like Llama-3
+- The scaling parameter $g$ is learned during training
+
+### Task C: The Training Loop
+
+Write a training loop that processes a batch of synthetic trajectories, calculates the cross-entropy loss, and performs backpropagation.
+
+**Requirements**:
+- Process batches of sequences
+- Compute loss using teacher forcing
+- Implement gradient clipping (max norm = 1.0)
+- Log training metrics (loss, perplexity)
+- Save checkpoints every 1000 steps
+
+## 4. Dataset: Synthetic Trajectories
+
+We provide a script `src/assignments/scratch-1/generate_data.py` that creates 10,000 synthetic robot trajectories. Each trajectory consists of a 7-DOF robot arm moving toward a target.
+
+**Dataset Specifications**:
+- **State Space**: 7-DOF joint angles + 3D end-effector position
+- **Action Space**: Discretized into 256 bins per dimension
+- **Sequence Length**: 50 timesteps per trajectory
+- **Vocabulary Size**: 256 tokens
+
+**Data Format**:
+```python
+{
+    'trajectories': torch.Tensor,  # Shape: (10000, 50, 10)
+    'tokenized': torch.LongTensor  # Shape: (10000, 50) - discretized actions
+}
+```
+
+### Generating the Dataset
+
+```bash
+cd src/assignments/scratch-1
+python generate_data.py --output data/trajectories.pkl
+```
+
+## 5. Submission
+
+### Code Submission
+
+Commit your implementation to your student branch in the `arpg/vla-foundations` repo:
+
+```bash
+git checkout -b scratch-1-yourname
+git add src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py
+git commit -m "Complete Scratch-1: Transformer Backbone"
+git push origin scratch-1-yourname
+```
+
+Open a pull request to the `staging` branch with:
+- Title: `Scratch-1: [Your Name]`
+- Description: Brief summary of your implementation
+
+### Report Submission
+
+Create an MDX page at `content/course/submissions/scratch-1/[your-name].mdx` with the following sections:
+
+#### Required Content
+
+1. **Loss Curve**: Plot training loss over iterations
+2. **Attention Maps**: Visualize attention patterns for a sample trajectory
+3. **The Audit**: Explain what happens to the loss if you remove the Causal Mask. Why does the model "cheat"?

+
+## 8. Getting Started
+
+### 1. Generate the Dataset
+
+```bash
+cd src/assignments/scratch-1
+python generate_data.py --num_trajectories 10000 --seq_length 50
+```
+
+### 2. Review the Template
+
+Open `src/assignments/scratch-1/backbone.py` and locate the `# TODO` markers.
+
+### 3. Implement the Components
+
+Start with RMSNorm (simplest), then move to Attention, then the full model.
+
+### 4. Train the Model
+
+```bash
+python train.py --data data/trajectories.pkl --epochs 10
+```
+
+### 5. Visualize Results
+
+```bash
+python visualize.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt
+```
+
+## 9. Common Pitfalls
+
+### Attention Masking
+- **Mistake**: Applying mask after softmax
+- **Fix**: Mask must be applied before softmax (`logits + mask`)
+
+### RoPE Implementation
+- **Mistake**: Rotating the entire embedding
+- **Fix**: Only rotate pairs of dimensions (see template)
+
+### Training Instability
+- **Mistake**: No gradient clipping
+- **Fix**: Use `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)`
+
+### Memory Issues
+- **Mistake**: Storing entire attention matrix
+- **Fix**: Use efficient attention implementations or smaller batch sizes
+
+## 10. FAQs
+
+**Q: Can I use einops for cleaner tensor operations?**
+A: Yes, but document what each einops operation does.
+
+**Q: Can I use Flash Attention?**
+A: Not for the base implementation. Flash Attention can be used for the Mastery bonus.
+
+**Q: How long should training take?**
+A: On a single GPU: ~10-15 minutes for 10k trajectories. On CPU: ~1 hour.
+
+**Q: What batch size should I use?**
+A: Start with 32. Increase if you have more VRAM.
+
+**Q: My loss isn't converging. Help?**
+A: Check:
+1. Is the causal mask applied correctly?
+2. Is the learning rate too high? (Try 1e-4)
+3. Are gradients exploding? (Enable gradient clipping)
+
+## 11. Deadline
+
+**Due**: Tuesday, January 27, 9:00 AM MST
+
+Late submissions: 10% penalty per day (max 3 days late)
