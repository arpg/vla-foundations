# CSCI 7000: VLA Foundations for Robotics

## Course Information

- **Instructor**: Christoffer Heckman
- **Semester**: Spring 2026
- **Credits**: 3
- **Level**: Graduate

## Course Description

This graduate seminar explores the emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for robotics. Students will critically analyze state-of-the-art research, implement core VLA techniques, and contribute to the living textbook at vlm-robotics.dev.

The course emphasizes rigorous technical validation, reproducibility, and practical deployment considerations for embodied AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Critically evaluate** VLA research papers using principled validation criteria
2. **Implement** core VLA components (encoders, policies, training pipelines)
3. **Design** experiments to test generalization and robustness claims
4. **Contribute** technical content to an open-source educational resource
5. **Articulate** the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment

## Course Structure

### The Living Textbook

Students will contribute directly to the **8-chapter VLA textbook** hosted at vlm-robotics.dev:

0. Foundations - Core concepts and problem formulation
1. Architectures - Model designs and network topologies
2. Data - Dataset construction and curation strategies
3. Training - Optimization and fine-tuning methods
4. Evaluation - Metrics and benchmarking protocols
5. Deployment - Production systems and scaling
6. Applications - Real-world use cases and case studies
7. Future Directions - Open problems and research frontiers

### Weekly Seminars

- **Tuesday/Thursday**: Paper discussions and technical deep-dives
- **Format**: Student-led presentations followed by group critique
- **Expectation**: All students complete assigned readings and submit questions beforehand

## Assignments

### 1. Scratch-0: Environment Setup (Week 1)

- **Due**: End of Week 1
- **Points**: 50
- **Deliverable**: GitHub PR with contributor profile

Verify your development environment and submit your first pull request to the course repository.

### 2. Paper Audit (Ongoing)

- **Due**: One audit every 2 weeks (4 total)
- **Points**: 200 (50 each)
- **Deliverable**: Markdown file with critical analysis

Select a VLA paper, reproduce key claims, and document findings. Focus on:
- Reproducibility of results
- Generalization claims vs. evidence
- Deployment feasibility
- Methodological rigor

### 3. Capstone Project (Weeks 8-16)

- **Due**: Final presentation in Week 16
- **Points**: 300
- **Deliverable**: Textbook chapter contribution + implementation

Choose one of:
- **Research Track**: Extend existing VLA work with novel experiments
- **Engineering Track**: Implement a production-grade VLA component
- **Survey Track**: Comprehensive literature review on a VLA subtopic

All tracks must include:
1. Textbook chapter contribution (written content + LaTeX equations)
2. Code implementation (if applicable)
3. Final presentation to the class

## Grading

| Component | Points | Percentage |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Scratch-0 | 50 | 9% |
| Paper Audits (4 × 50) | 200 | 36% |
| Capstone Project | 300 | 55% |
| **Total** | **550** | **100%** |

### Grading Scale

- A: 90-100%
- B: 80-89%
- C: 70-79%
- D: 60-69%
- F: <60%

## Course Policies

### Attendance

- Attendance is **mandatory** for all seminars
- Students may miss up to 2 sessions without penalty (notify instructor in advance)
- Additional absences will result in grade penalties

### Late Work

- Paper Audits: 10% penalty per day late (max 3 days)
- Capstone: No late submissions accepted (present on final day)

### Academic Integrity

- All code must be original or properly attributed
- Collaboration is encouraged for learning, but submissions must be individual
- Use of LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) must be documented and attributed
- Plagiarism will result in course failure and university disciplinary action

### Accessibility

Students with disabilities should contact the instructor and Disability Services within the first two weeks of the semester to arrange accommodations.

## Required Tools

- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **Python 3.10+**: Primary programming language
- **PyTorch 2.0+**: Deep learning framework
- **MDX/LaTeX**: Technical writing and equations
- **SSH/Linux**: Remote server access for experiments

## Resources

- **Textbook**: vlm-robotics.dev (living document)
- **GitHub**: arpg/vla-foundations
- **Papers**: ArXiv, CoRL, RSS, ICRA, IROS
- **Datasets**: Open-X Embodiment, DROID, BridgeData
