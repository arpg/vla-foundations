# Scratch-0: Environment Setup

**Objective**: Verify your development environment and submit your first pull request to the VLA Foundations repository.

## 1. Prerequisites

Install the following tools:

- **Git**: Version control
- **Python 3.10+**: Primary programming language
- **PyTorch 2.0+**: Deep learning framework
- **Node.js 18+**: For building the course website

## 2. Task: Create Your Contributor Profile

Create a new file at `content/contributors/[your-github-handle].mdx` with the following structure:

```mdx
---
name: "Your Full Name"
role: "Student"
semester: "Spring 2026"
github: "your-github-handle"
---

# About Me

Brief introduction about yourself and your research interests.

## Academic Background

- **University**: Your University
- **Major**: Your Major
- **Year**: Your Year

## Research Interests

- Vision-Language-Action models
- Robot learning
- [Your specific interests]

## Contact

- **Email**: your.email@university.edu
- **GitHub**: [@your-handle](https://github.com/your-handle)
```

## 3. Environment Verification

Run the following script to verify your PyTorch installation:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def verify_setup():
    # 1. Check CUDA
    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    print(f"Running on: {device}")

    # 2. Test Linear Projection (Modality Bridge Simulation)
    # Projecting a 1024-dim vision token to a 4096-dim language latent
    bridge = nn.Linear(1024, 4096).to(device)
    x = torch.randn(1, 1024).to(device)
    y = bridge(x)

    assert y.shape == (1, 4096), "Projection Shape Mismatch"
    print("Environment Sync: SUCCESS")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_setup()
```

Expected output:
```
Running on: cuda  # or "cpu" if no GPU available
Environment Sync: SUCCESS
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Workflow Integrity
* **NEVER** push directly to `staging`.
* **NEVER** force-push (`-f`) to any branch that isn't your own feature branch.
* If your build fails in CI but passes locally, it is likely a Case-Sensitivity issue (Linux CI vs. Mac/Win local) or malformed YAML frontmatter. **Check the GitHub Action logs first.**

## 4. Submission Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b student/[your-handle]-init
```

Example: `git checkout -b student/johndoe-init`

### Step 2: Add Your Profile

```bash
git add content/contributors/[your-github-handle].mdx
git commit -m "Add contributor profile: Your Name"
```

### Step 3: Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin student/[your-handle]-init
```

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request

1. Go to https://github.com/arpg/vla-foundations
2. Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
3. **Base branch**: `staging` (NOT `main`)
4. **Compare branch**: `student/[your-handle]-init`
5. **Title**: `Scratch-0: Add contributor profile - Your Name`
6. **Description**: "Initial contributor profile for Scratch-0"
7. Click "Create pull request"

### Step 5: Wait for CI Checks

Your PR will trigger a GitHub Action that validates:
- MDX syntax is valid
- Frontmatter is properly formatted
- LaTeX rendering works
- Site builds successfully

**If the build fails**: Check the error logs, fix the issues in your MDX file, and push the changes. The CI will automatically re-run.

### Step 6: Instructor Review

**Important**: Only the instructor can merge your PR. You do not have merge permissions.

Once your PR passes all checks, the instructor will:
1. Review your profile
2. Provide feedback if needed
3. Merge to `staging`
4. Deploy to production

## 5. Evaluation

**Pass**: Your PR is merged into staging, and your profile appears on the [Contributors page](https://vlm-robotics.dev/contributors).

**Fail**: PR is left open or build is broken past the deadline.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: `git push` fails with permission denied

**Solution**: Make sure you're pushing to your own branch, not `main` or `staging`.

---

**Problem**: CI build fails with "Invalid frontmatter"

**Solution**: Check that your MDX file has valid YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters.

---

**Problem**: PyTorch not found

**Solution**: Install PyTorch following the [official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

---

**Problem**: Can't merge my own PR

**Solution**: This is expected. Only the instructor can merge PRs. Wait for review.

## 7. Getting Help

- **Office Hours**: Tuesday/Thursday 3-4 PM
- **Discussion Forum**: Post with `[scratch-0]` tag
- **Email**: christoffer.heckman@colorado.edu

## 8. Deadline

**Due**: End of Week 1 (Friday 11:59 PM)

Late submissions will incur a 10% penalty per day (max 3 days late).

**Welcome to VLA Foundations!** This assignment ensures you're ready for the technical work ahead.
