# Scratch-0: Environment Setup & First PR

## Objective

Verify your development environment and demonstrate proficiency with the course workflow by submitting your first pull request to the `vla-foundations` repository.

## Learning Goals

- Set up Git, Python, and required dependencies
- Understand the GitHub PR workflow for course submissions
- Practice MDX syntax and frontmatter
- Verify SSH access to development servers (if applicable)

## Requirements

### 1. Environment Setup

Install the following tools:

```bash
# Git (version control)
git --version  # Should be 2.30+

# Python (programming)
python --version  # Should be 3.10+

# Node.js (for Next.js site)
node --version  # Should be 18+
pnpm --version  # Should be 8+

# PyTorch (deep learning)
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"  # Should be 2.0+
```

### 2. Repository Access

Clone the course repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpg/vla-foundations.git
cd vla-foundations
pnpm install
```

### 3. Create Your Contributor Profile

**File location**: `content/contributors/your-github-username.mdx`

Use the provided template (`content/contributors/_template.mdx`) and fill in:

- Your full name
- Academic background (university, major, year)
- Research interests related to VLA/robotics
- GitHub profile link
- Email (optional)

**Example**:

```mdx
---
name: "Jane Doe"
role: "Student"
semester: "Spring 2026"
github: "janedoe"
---

# About Me

- **GitHub**: [@janedoe](https://github.com/janedoe)
```

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

**IMPORTANT**: You must create your own branch and submit a pull request. You do NOT have permission to merge your own PRs—only the instructor can merge.

**Steps**:

1. **Create a new branch** from your local repository:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-contributor-yourname
   ```
   Example: `git checkout -b add-contributor-johndoe`

2. **Add your contributor file**:
   ```bash
   git add content/contributors/your-github-username.mdx
   git commit -m "Add contributor profile: Your Name"
   ```

3. **Push your branch** to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-contributor-yourname
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/arpg/vla-foundations
   - Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
   - **Base branch**: `staging` (NOT `main`)
   - **Compare branch**: `add-contributor-yourname` (your branch)
   - **Title**: `Add contributor: Your Name`
   - **Description**: "Scratch-0 submission for Week 1"
   - Click "Create pull request"

5. **Wait for CI checks** to pass (GitHub Actions will validate your MDX syntax)

6. **Wait for instructor approval**:
   - The instructor will review your submission
   - You may be asked to make changes
   - **Only the instructor can merge your PR**
   - Once approved, the instructor will merge to `staging`, then deploy to production

**Do NOT attempt to merge your own pull request. You do not have merge permissions.**

### 5. Verify Build

Once your PR is merged by the instructor, verify your profile appears on the site:

- **Local**: Run `pnpm dev` and navigate to `/contributors`
- **Production**: Check https://vlm-robotics.dev/contributors

## Deliverables

- [ ] Contributor profile file created in `content/contributors/`
- [ ] Pull request submitted to `staging` branch
- [ ] All CI checks passing (contentlayer build, MDX validation)
- [ ] Profile appears on the live site after merge

## Grading Rubric

| Criterion | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Environment setup verified | 10 |
| MDX frontmatter valid | 10 |
| Content complete and professional | 15 |
| PR follows naming conventions | 5 |
| CI checks pass | 10 |
| **Total** | **50** |

## Common Issues

### MDX Syntax Errors

- Missing frontmatter delimiter (`---`)
- Invalid YAML in frontmatter
- Unclosed code blocks

**Fix**: Run `pnpm build-content` locally before submitting

### Git/GitHub Issues

- Forgot to create a branch (pushing directly to main)
- Wrong base branch for PR (should be `staging`)
- Merge conflicts (sync with upstream first)

**Fix**: Review Git workflow in course materials

### CI Failures

- Contentlayer build error (check MDX syntax)
- Linting errors (run `pnpm lint` locally)

**Fix**: Read error messages carefully and fix issues locally

## Deadline

**Due**: End of Week 1 (Friday 11:59 PM)

Late submissions will incur a 10% penalty per day.
