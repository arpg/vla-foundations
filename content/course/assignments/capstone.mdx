# Capstone Project: Textbook Contribution & Implementation

## Objective

Make a substantive contribution to the VLA Foundations textbook by authoring technical content, implementing code, and presenting your work to the class.

## Learning Goals

- **Synthesize** knowledge from multiple research papers
- **Implement** a non-trivial VLA component or experiment
- **Communicate** technical concepts clearly in writing
- **Present** findings to a technical audience

## Project Tracks

Choose **one** of the following tracks:

### Track 1: Research Extension

Extend an existing VLA paper with novel experiments or analysis.

**Requirements:**
- Reproduce baseline results from a published paper
- Design and run new experiments that test an unexplored dimension
- Contribute a textbook section analyzing your findings

**Example Projects:**
- "Does RT-2 generalize to novel object geometries?" - Test on CAD-generated objects
- "Scaling laws for VLA data diversity" - Ablate dataset composition
- "Failure modes of diffusion policies in cluttered scenes" - Systematic failure analysis

### Track 2: Engineering Implementation

Build a production-grade VLA component from scratch.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a key VLA technique (encoder, policy, training pipeline)
- Write clean, documented, tested code
- Contribute a textbook section with implementation details

**Example Projects:**
- "Efficient vision encoder for real-time robotic control" - Optimized transformer
- "Multi-task policy training framework" - PyTorch training harness
- "Sim-to-real transfer toolkit" - Domain randomization + evaluation suite

### Track 3: Comprehensive Survey

Write an authoritative survey of a VLA subtopic.

**Requirements:**
- Read 15-20 papers in a focused area
- Identify trends, gaps, and open questions
- Contribute a textbook section synthesizing the literature

**Example Projects:**
- "Data augmentation strategies for robotic learning" - Survey + taxonomy
- "Benchmarking protocols for manipulation tasks" - Analysis of evaluation methods

## FAQs

**Q: Can I work in a team?**
A: No, capstone projects must be individual work. However, you can discuss ideas with classmates.

**Q: Can I extend my paper audit into a capstone?**
A: Yes! If you found an interesting research question during a paper audit, you can explore it further.

**Q: What if my code doesn't work perfectly?**
A: Document what worked, what didn't, and why. Partial results are acceptable if well-analyzed.

**Q: Can I contribute to multiple textbook chapters?**
A: Focus on one cohesive section. Quality over quantity.

**Q: What if my project scope changes?**
A: Discuss with the instructor. Pivots are allowed with justification.

## Getting Help

- **Office Hours**: Every Tuesday/Thursday 3-4 PM
- **Discussion Forum**: Post questions and get peer feedback
- **Mid-Project Check-In**: Schedule a meeting in Week 12

## Final Notes

The capstone is your opportunity to make a lasting contribution to the VLA research community. Past student projects have been cited in papers, used by other researchers, and featured in the textbook for future cohorts.

**Aim for work you'd be proud to showcase in a job interview or PhD application.**

Good luck!
