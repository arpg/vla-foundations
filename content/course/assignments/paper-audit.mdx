# Paper Audit: Critical Analysis of VLA Research

## Objective

Develop critical reading skills by deeply analyzing VLA research papers, attempting to reproduce key claims, and documenting findings for the research community.

## Learning Goals

- **Evaluate** research claims against experimental evidence
- **Reproduce** core results from published papers
- **Identify** gaps between claims and validation
- **Communicate** technical findings clearly and rigorously

## Assignment Overview

You will complete **4 paper audits** throughout the semester (one every 2 weeks, 50 points each).

Each audit requires:
1. Selecting a VLA paper from the approved list
2. Reading and understanding the methodology
3. Attempting to reproduce key claims (code, experiments, or analysis)
4. Writing a structured critique in Markdown
5. Submitting via pull request to the course repository

## Paper Selection

### Approved Papers

Choose from recent VLA publications in top venues:

**Foundational Models:**
- RT-1: Robotics Transformer for Real-World Control at Scale
- RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control
- PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
- Octo: An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy

**Data & Training:**
- Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models
- DROID: A Large-Scale In-the-Wild Robot Manipulation Dataset
- BridgeData V2: A Dataset for Robot Learning at Scale
- Learning Fine-Grained Bimanual Manipulation with Low-Cost Hardware (ALOHA)

**Architectures & Methods:**
- Perceiver-Actor: A Multi-Task Transformer for Robotic Manipulation
- Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion
- 3D Diffuser Actor: Policy Diffusion with 3D Scene Representations
- VoxPoser: Composable 3D Value Maps for Robotic Manipulation with Language Models

**Evaluation & Deployment:**
- What Matters in Training a GPT4-Leveraged Hierarchical Robot Policy?
- On Bringing Robots Home
- The Challenges of Deploying Reinforcement Learning Agents in the Real World
- RoboCat: A Self-Improving Foundation Agent for Robotic Manipulation

**Custom Selection:**
If you want to audit a paper not on this list, get instructor approval first.

## Audit Structure

Your audit should be a **Markdown file** (~2000-3000 words) with the following sections:

### 1. Paper Summary (200-300 words)

- What problem does the paper address?
- What is the proposed method/system?
- What are the key claims?

### 2. Methodology Analysis (400-600 words)

- Experimental setup and datasets
- Evaluation metrics and baselines
- Ablation studies and controls
- What is measured vs. what is claimed

### 3. Reproducibility Assessment (600-800 words)

**Code Availability:**
- Is code publicly available?
- Are dependencies documented?
- Can you run the code out-of-the-box?

**Data Availability:**
- Are datasets accessible?
- Are data collection procedures documented?
- Can results be reproduced with provided data?

**Reproduction Attempts:**
- What did you try to reproduce? (e.g., a figure, table, or claim)
- What succeeded? What failed?
- What was unclear or missing?

### 4. Critical Evaluation (600-800 words)

**Strengths:**
- What does this paper do well?
- What claims are well-supported?
- What contributions are valuable?

**Weaknesses:**
- What claims are overstated?
- What experiments are missing?
- What alternative explanations exist?

**Deployment Feasibility:**
- Would this work in production?
- What are the real-world constraints?
- What failure modes exist?

### 5. Research Impact (200-300 words)

- How does this paper advance the field?
- What follow-up questions does it raise?
- What would you do differently?

### 6. References

- Full citation for the paper
- Links to code, data, and supplementary materials
- Related work you referenced

```

## Submission Process

1. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b paper-audit-N-yourname
   ```

2. **Add your audit file**:
   ```bash
   content/course/paper-audits/yourname-audit-N.md
   ```

3. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add content/course/paper-audits/yourname-audit-N.md
   git commit -m "Add Paper Audit #N: [Paper Title]"
   git push origin paper-audit-N-yourname
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request** to the `staging` branch

5. **Instructor Review**: You'll receive feedback and may be asked to revise

## Grading Rubric (50 points per audit)

| Criterion | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Paper summary accurate and concise | 5 |
| Methodology analysis thorough | 10 |
| Reproducibility attempts documented | 15 |
| Critical evaluation insightful | 15 |
| Writing clarity and professionalism | 5 |
| **Total** | **50** |

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Early**: Reproducing results takes time (often longer than expected)
2. **Document Everything**: Track what you tried, even if it failed
3. **Be Specific**: Cite line numbers, figure numbers, table numbers
4. **Be Fair**: Acknowledge both strengths and weaknesses
5. **Be Rigorous**: Back up claims with evidence

## Common Pitfalls

- **Surface-level analysis**: Don't just summarize the abstract
- **No reproduction attempt**: You must try to run code or reproduce a result
- **Unsubstantiated claims**: "This seems wrong" without evidence
- **Ignoring context**: Consider the paper's publication date and available resources
