# Assignment: The Technical Paper Audit

**Weight:** 20% (Document) + 10% (Presentation)  
**Initial Draft Due:** Exactly 7 days prior to your scheduled presentation date.  
**Mastery Deadline:** Sunday, April 19, 11:59 PM MST.

## 1. The Philosophy: Audit, Not Summary

In this course, we do not write "summaries." A summary is a transient document that parrots the authors' abstract. An **Audit** is a durable engineering resource intended for the `vlm-robotics.dev` living textbook.

As a technical auditor, your job is to pressure-test the paper’s claims from a first-principles perspective. You are looking for the "Information Decay"—the points where the model’s architectural choices sacrifice physical reality for computational ease. If this paper were a technical proposal at an organization like Zoox or Tesla, would you sign off on it? Why or why not?

## 2. The Mastery Loop (Grading & Feedback)

This assignment utilizes a **Mastery-Based Feedback Loop**. Your grade reflects the technical authority and durability of your documentation.

1.  **The Review Candidate (T-minus 7 Days):** Submit a draft of your MDX document via a Pull Request (PR) to the `staging` branch. 
2.  **Instructor Review (IR):** I will provide a technical review focusing on mathematical rigor, architectural clarity, and the depth of your critique.
3.  **The Presentation:** Deliver a "presentationified" version of your audit to the class. 
4.  **The Improvement Cycle:** You are expected to iterate on your MDX document throughout the semester based on IR and class feedback. 
    * **Level 1 (C):** A correct summary with basic formatting.
    * **Level 2 (B):** High technical depth, correct $\LaTeX$, and a sound critique of the model.
    * **Level 3 (A - Mastery):** "Merge-Ready." The document is of such high quality that it is merged into the `main` branch of the living textbook as a canonical reference.

## 3. Technical Requirements

Your audit must be authored in MDX and include the following sections.

### I. Formal Architecture
You must formalize the model’s core logic using $\LaTeX$. Do not simply describe the objective; derive it.
* Define the state-space and the latent transitions.
* Explicitly detail the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ and any auxiliary objectives (e.g., contrastive or reconstruction losses).
* **Example:** Define the joint probability for an autoregressive VLA:
    $$P(a_{1:T} | v_{1:T}, l) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(a_t | v_{\le t}, a_{<t}, l)$$

### II. The Instructor Audit Criteria
Address the following engineering bottlenecks:
* **Dimensionality & Information Decay:** Where is the bottleneck? Does the projection layer ($v \to z$) discard critical spatial geometry (e.g., depth, texture, or contact physics) needed for the task?
* **Compute & Inference Reality:** Estimate the FLOPs for a single forward pass. At what frequency (Hz) can this model realistically run on edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Orin or H100)?
* **The Semantic-Motor Gap:** Identify exactly where the model's "high-level reasoning" (the LLM) fails to ground in "low-level motor primitives" (the policy).

### III. Failure Mode Analysis
Document the "Obvious Bugs." Identify 2–3 scenarios where the model’s logic is likely to diverge from physical reality (e.g., handling transparent objects, high-velocity dynamic obstacles, or long-horizon causal chains).

## 5. Submission Logistics

1.  **Branching:** Create a branch `audit/your-name-paper-name`.
2.  **PR to Staging:** Submit your MDX file to `content/textbook/audits/`.
3.  **Build Check:** Your PR must pass the GitHub Action audit (no broken $\LaTeX$ or malformed frontmatter).
4.  **Instructor Sync:** Once the build is green, tag `@chrisheckman` for Instructor Review.
