# Assignment: The Technical Paper Audit

**Weight:** 20% (Document) + 10% (Presentation)
**Initial Draft Due:** Exactly 7 days prior to your scheduled presentation date.
**Mastery Deadline:** Sunday, April 19, 11:59 PM MST.

## The Philosophy: Audit, Not Summary

In this course, we do not write "summaries." A summary is a transient document that parrots the authors' abstract. An **Audit** is a durable engineering resource intended for the `vlm-robotics.dev` living textbook.

As a technical auditor, your job is to pressure-test the paper's claims from a first-principles perspective. You are looking for the "Information Decay"—the points where the model's architectural choices sacrifice physical reality for computational ease. If this paper were a technical proposal at an organization like Zoox or Tesla, would you sign off on it? Why or why not?

## FAQ: The VLA Paper Audit & Presentation

### Scope & Technical Focus

**What is the "Primary Paper" meant to convey?**

Consider this your anchor—the central node in a knowledge graph for your chosen sub-domain. If you choose a work like **VQ-BeT**, your audit is primarily about the *Vector Quantization for Actions* lineage. You then use secondary papers (RT-1, FAST, etc.) to show the evolution, contrast, or failure modes of that technical path.

**Why are "simple" approaches like RT-1's binning included?**

RT-1 isn't included because its "how" is complex—it's included because its "so what" is the punchline. It proved that robotic actions could be treated as language and scaled. Your audit shouldn't spend pages on the mechanics of binning; it should spend pages on its **limitations** (discretization error, loss of multi-modality, scaling bottlenecks) and why newer architectures were forced to innovate.

**What does it mean to "Audit the Interface"?**

Focus on how subcomponents interact. In today's architectures, the "Initial Dissolve" often happens at the boundary between modules.

- **Example:** If a model uses a frozen ViT to output actions via an LLM, the "interface" is the projection between the ViT and the decoder, or the mapping between the decoder and the action tokens.
- **Avoid:** Spending time on standard Transformer blocks unless they've been specifically modified for the VLA task.
- **Prioritize:** Input projections, action heads, and the specific objective functions being optimized.

### Format & Objectives

**Should this be a summary or a technical argument?**

**Stop summarizing and start arguing.** Pick a technical thesis (e.g., *"Latent action quantization is the only path to high-precision VLA"*) and use the papers to prove or disprove it. I don't want a "useful summary"; I want a critical autopsy that identifies where these models fail and what the next scaling step is.

**Is the audit an educational tool or a technical document?**

Following the **Amazon Principle**, these are identical. A high-fidelity technical document is, by definition, the best educational tool. We do not create "explanatory" versions for students and "rigorous" versions for the textbook; we do the work once, correctly.

**Is a Technical Recommendation required?**

**No.** A recommendation requires variables we haven't defined (compute budget, hardware constraints, data availability). Your job is to map the **geometry of the technical trade-offs**. Show us where the "load-bearing walls" are, not which house to buy.

### Presentation Logistics

**How does the presentation differ from the audit?**

The **Audit** is your exhaustive "Single Source of Truth." The **Presentation** is your technical brief. Use the presentation to distill the main points, highlight the most critical trade-offs, and register your technical opinion at a higher level.

**What is the time allocation?**

Moving forward, we will target approximately **30 minutes** for the reading/audit discussion and **35 minutes** for the presentation and peer-to-peer technical deep dive.

## Submission Requirements & Technical Standards

The Paper Audit is not a book report; it is an exhaustive technical autopsy of a specific sub-domain within the VLM-Robotics landscape. You are expected to synthesize the foundational literature and the current SOTA into a single, authoritative dossier.

### Format Specifications

- **Template:** Use a standard LaTeX article or conference template.
- **Length:** **Exhaustive.** There is no page limit. The audit is complete only when the technical landscape of your chosen sub-domain is fully mapped and the underlying scaling laws and architectural trade-offs are articulated.
- **Scope:** Your audit must cover the **primary foundational paper** of your chosen topic plus **all relevant descendant and competing works** (typically 5-10+ papers) that define the current frontier.

### Required Structural Components

#### Problem Domain & Taxonomy

Define the specific technical challenge (e.g., *Symmetric Sigmoid Losses in Multimodal Pre-training* or *Self-Distillation for Geometric Robotics Foundations*). Provide a taxonomy of the approaches taken by different research groups. How has the "Initial Dissolve" of this problem evolved over the last 24–36 months?

#### Comparative Architectural Deep-Dive

Construct a rigorous technical comparison of the architectures involved.
- **Objective Functions:** Compare the mathematical formulations (e.g., InfoNCE vs. SigLIP vs. DINO distillation).
- **Backbone Scaling:** Contrast the vision/language encoders used across the papers. Analyze how parameter count and data volume influenced the results.
- **Interaction Mechanisms:** Detail the differences in how these models fuse modalities (e.g., Cross-attention, Q-Formers, or simple MLP projections).

You must formalize the model's core logic using $\LaTeX$. Do not simply describe the objective; derive it.
- Define the state-space and the latent transitions.
- Explicitly detail the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ and any auxiliary objectives (e.g., contrastive or reconstruction losses).
- **Example:** Define the joint probability for an autoregressive VLA:
    $$P(a_{1:T} | v_{1:T}, l) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(a_t | v_{\le t}, a_{<t}, l)$$

#### The Scaling Frontier & Empirical Trends

Identify the scaling laws revealed by the collective body of work.
- What are the compute-optimal frontiers for this sub-domain?
- Where do the "diminishing returns" or "data walls" appear in these specific approaches?
- Use data from the papers to construct a narrative of how performance correlates with scale in this specific area.

#### Robotic Grounding & Physicality Gap

This is the most critical section. Evaluate how these visual-language representations survive the transition to the physical world.
- Analyze the "Precision Gap": How do these models handle the high-frequency requirements of robotic control?
- Critique the benchmarks: Are the papers testing on static datasets (ImageNet/COCO) or embodied environments (RT-X, Open X-Embodiment)?
- Identify exactly where the "semantic understanding" fails to translate into "physical common sense."

Address the following engineering bottlenecks:
- **Dimensionality & Information Decay:** Where is the bottleneck? Does the projection layer ($v \to z$) discard critical spatial geometry (e.g., depth, texture, or contact physics) needed for the task?
- **Compute & Inference Reality:** Estimate the FLOPs for a single forward pass. At what frequency (Hz) can this model realistically run on edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Orin or H100)?
- **The Semantic-Motor Gap:** Identify exactly where the model's "high-level reasoning" (the LLM) fails to ground in "low-level motor primitives" (the policy).

#### Critical Synthesis & The "Load-Bearing" Audit

Identify the "load-bearing" assumptions of the entire sub-domain.
- What happens if the internet-scale data used for pre-training is exhausted?
- Which of these papers are truly foundational, and which are merely "marginal gain" iterations?
- Propose the "Next Step" for the field: If you were a Senior Staff Engineer at a robotics lab, what would be the next 10,000 GPU-hour experiment you would run to advance this sub-domain?

Document the "Obvious Bugs." Identify 2–3 scenarios where the model's logic is likely to diverge from physical reality (e.g., handling transparent objects, high-velocity dynamic obstacles, or long-horizon causal chains).

## The Mastery Loop

This assignment utilizes a **Mastery-Based Feedback Loop**. Your grade reflects the technical authority and durability of your documentation.

- **The Review Candidate (T-minus 7 Days):** Submit a draft of your MDX document via a Pull Request (PR) to the `staging` branch.
- **Instructor Review (IR):** I will provide a technical review focusing on mathematical rigor, architectural clarity, and the depth of your critique.
- **The Presentation:** Deliver a "presentationified" version of your audit to the class.
- **The Improvement Cycle:** You are expected to iterate on your MDX document throughout the semester based on IR and class feedback.
  * **Level 1 (C):** A correct summary with basic formatting.
  * **Level 2 (B):** High technical depth, correct $\LaTeX$, and a sound critique of the model.
  * **Level 3 (A - Mastery):** "Merge-Ready." The document is of such high quality that it is merged into the `main` branch of the living textbook as a canonical reference.
