# About Me

I am a PhD student with the Human Interaction & Robotics Group at the University of Colorado Boulder advised by Alessandro Roncone. My research interests lie in whole-body perception and learning for collaborative generalized robotics. Specifically, my research is focused on establishing a body schema in robots through tactile sensing and artificial peri-personal space.
