# About Me

I am a PhD student working on decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on active information gathering and belief-driven planning.
My research develops principled methods for reasoning over uncertainty to select informative actions that improve downstream decision quality.
I am particularly interested in applications to autonomous pedestrian navigation, where agents must act safely under partial observability, and to improving weather prediction, where targeted sensing can reduce forecast uncertainty and enable more effective planning.
