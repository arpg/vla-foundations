# About Me

I am a PhD student co-advised by Dr. Alessandro Roncone and Dr. Bradley Hayes.
My research interests are in human-robot interaction and environment design,
enabling context-aware reasoning and environment shaping in dynamic settings.
I am interested in develop learning systems that integrate interactive feedback,
behavioral modeling, and task reasoning for robust decision-making under uncertainty.
