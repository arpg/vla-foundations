# About Me

I'm a first year CS PhD student with 5 years in the robotics startup space.
My hands on field experience includes deploying strawberry picking robots 
on farms in the UK and CA as well electric autonomous lawnmowers across the US.
My current research is on the use of mmWave radar in outdoor robotic applications, 
advised by Prof. Heckamn in the ARPG lab.  

Outside of the lab, I'm a voracious read of all things sci-fi and fantasy, 
a recoverying rugby player limping through classic CO outdoor activiites and a 
volunteer at my local tool library.
