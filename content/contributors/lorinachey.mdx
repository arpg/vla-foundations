# About Me

I develop algorithms and AI models that enable mobile robots to perceive, predict,
and act effectively in complex, partially observed, and egocentric environments.
My work focuses on: multi-modal machine perception for 3D scene understanding, generative occupancy modeling,
and Vision–Language–Action (VLA) models that unify perception, language, and control for grounded decision-making.
