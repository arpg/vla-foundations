# About Me

I am a 2018 CU Boulder Alum with undergraduate degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science. I've been working in the robotics industry the last 7 years. I currently work for Lunar Outpost as a Senior Robotics Engineer. I'm currently pursing a PhD in the (newly formed) Robotics Program. I decided to come back to school because I've implemented multiple robotic systems that are capable up to 90% of the time and I want to solve the remaining 10% effectively. When I'm not working, doing school work, or TAing, you can find me at live music events, doing yoga, or playing hockey.
