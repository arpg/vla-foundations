# About Me

Hi, I’m Zaki. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. I received a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering also at CU Boulder. My research revolves around planning and control under uncertainty. I have worked on contingency management of UAS under component failures using MPC and POMDP methods. I am currently working on efficient multi-agent planning for search and rescue. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and skiing.
