# About Me

I'm a computer science Ph.D. student currently studying strategic information interactions
in adversarial multiagent systems. At the time of writing, I've recently taken my research
from Vanderbilt University to CU Boulder to perform interdisciplinary work between
computer science and aerospace.

## Academic Background

- **University**: University of Colorado Boulder
- **Major**: Computer Science
- **Year**: 4th in Ph.D. (first at CU)

## Research Interests

I study multiagent systems - often, but not always, robotic systems. In particular, I'm
interested in agents with different objectives and environments that are not
fully observable. Under these circumstances, agents interact in information space: they must
decide how to manage information to best inform (or deceive) their counterparts. As such, 
I'm interested in VLAs from the standpoint of using embodied language as a vehicle 
for strategically conveying information to other agents. 

List your research interests related to:
- Vision-Language-Action models
- Robotics
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision

## Projects

Thus far I remain an LLM skeptic and have yet to introduce language modeling into any 
projects, even for code assistance. We'll see if that changes as I learn more. 

That said, I do have experience with robotics projects. My core multiagent work is mostly 
simulated, but I've dipped my toes into computer vision (using it for scene
reconstruction in a surgical robotics project).
