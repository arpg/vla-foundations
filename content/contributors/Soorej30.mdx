# About Me

I am a first year Masters student pursuing my degree in Data Science. I have over 4 years of industry experience working as a Senior Data Scientist at XPO Logistics.
I have worked on multiple projects on computer vision models and image processing and also on LLM models and NLP based projects, now I would like to learn to integrate these together to create a multimodal system and understand the underlying theoretical concepts.
