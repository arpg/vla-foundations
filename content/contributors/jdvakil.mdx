# About Me

I am a second year PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder advised by Prof. Alessandro Roncone. 
My research focuses on embodied AI, specifically in the context of robot learning. 
I am particularly interested in developing learning-based approaches which go beyond the realm of vision and 
operate in low data regimes.

In my past life, I was a researcher at Meta AI (Fundamental AI Research) where 
I worked on projects like [RoboAgent](https://robopen.github.io/), 
[RT-X or Open X-embodiment](https://rt-x.github.io/), and [OK-Robot](https://ok-robots.github.io/).

These days, I'm working on enabling robots to learn from distributed whole-body sensing, 
essentially helping robots perceive and understand their peripersonal space using distributed 
egocentric perception data from whole-body sensors.
