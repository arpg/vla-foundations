# Chapter 3: Training

## Core Questions

- Can foundation models serve as zero-shot planners?
- How do we bridge the gap between token prediction and physical action?
- What role does chain-of-thought play in robotics?

## Topics

### 2.1 Planning vs. Execution
- The inference-to-control pipeline
- Temporal credit assignment
- Failure recovery strategies

### 2.2 Foundation Models as World Models
- Zero-shot task adaptation
- In-context learning for robotics
- The limits of pre-training

### 2.3 Chain-of-Thought in Physical Space
- Decomposing complex tasks
- Spatial reasoning with LLMs
- Error propagation in multi-step plans
