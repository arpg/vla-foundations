# Chapter 4: Evaluation

## Core Questions

- How do we measure success in open-ended robotic tasks?
- What metrics capture both capability and safety?
- How do we validate models before real-world deployment?

## Topics

### 4.1 Success Metrics
- Task completion rates
- Efficiency and execution time
- Graceful degradation under failure
- Multi-dimensional performance trade-offs

### 4.2 Safety and Robustness
- Out-of-distribution detection
- Adversarial robustness testing
- Failure mode analysis
- Safety-critical validation frameworks

### 4.3 Benchmarking Protocols
- Standardized evaluation suites
- Sim-to-real gap measurement
- Cross-platform reproducibility
- The generalization challenge

### 4.4 Human Evaluation
- User studies and preference metrics
- Expert vs. novice assessments
- Long-term deployment studies
- Ethical considerations in evaluation
