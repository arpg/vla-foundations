# Problem Domain & Taxonomy

Define the specific technical challenge this paper addresses. What bottleneck in the VLM/VLA landscape does it target?

## Context

Brief history of the problem space (2-3 paragraphs).

## Taxonomy of Approaches

Classify how different research groups have approached this problem.

# Comparative Architectural Deep-Dive

## Objective Functions

Compare mathematical formulations. For example:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{InfoNCE}} = -\log \frac{\exp(s(v, t^+)/\tau)}{\sum_{t' \in \mathcal{T}} \exp(s(v, t')/\tau)}$$

versus

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{SigLIP}} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \log \sigma(z_i \cdot y_i)$$

## Backbone Scaling

Analyze encoder architectures, parameter counts, and training data volumes.

## Interaction Mechanisms

Detail how modalities are fused (cross-attention, Q-Formers, MLP projections).

# The Scaling Frontier & Empirical Trends

Identify compute-optimal frontiers and data walls from collective research.

## Scaling Laws

Present empirical relationships between scale and performance.

## Diminishing Returns

Where do marginal gains plateau?

# Robotic Grounding & Physicality Gap

## The Precision Gap

How do these models handle high-frequency robotic control requirements?

## Benchmark Critique

Are tests on static datasets (ImageNet/COCO) or embodied environments (RT-X)?

## Engineering Bottlenecks

- **Dimensionality & Information Decay:** Where does the model discard critical spatial information?
- **Compute & Inference Reality:** FLOPs per forward pass? Hz on edge hardware (Orin, H100)?
- **Semantic-Motor Gap:** Where does high-level reasoning fail to ground in motor primitives?

# Critical Synthesis & The "Load-Bearing" Audit

## Load-Bearing Assumptions

What happens if internet-scale pre-training data is exhausted?

## Foundational vs. Marginal Gains

Which papers are truly foundational? Which are incremental?

## Failure Modes

Document 2-3 scenarios where the model diverges from physical reality:
- Transparent objects
- High-velocity dynamic obstacles
- Long-horizon causal chains

## The Next 10,000 GPU-Hour Experiment

If you were a Senior Staff Engineer, what would you run next?
