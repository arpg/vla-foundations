# Chapter 2: Data

## Core Questions

- How do we collect diverse, high-quality robotics data at scale?
- What annotation strategies work for multi-modal robotic datasets?
- How do we ensure data quality and avoid distribution drift?

## Topics

### 2.1 Data Collection Strategies
- Teleoperation vs. autonomous collection
- Multi-robot data aggregation
- Simulation-to-real transfer
- Sensor calibration and synchronization

### 2.2 Annotation and Labeling
- Human-in-the-loop annotation
- Foundation model-based auto-labeling
- Quality assurance and validation
- The cost-quality trade-off

### 2.3 Dataset Curation
- Diversity metrics and coverage analysis
- Handling edge cases and long-tail scenarios
- Data augmentation for robotics
- Privacy and safety considerations

### 2.4 Benchmark Datasets
- Standard evaluation datasets
- Domain-specific benchmarks
- Transfer learning across datasets
- The reproducibility crisis
