# Chapter 0: Foundations

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) stack represents the fundamental architecture for building intelligent robotic systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## The Core Problem

Given:
- Scene encoding (visual perception)
- Natural language instruction (task specification)

Find:
- Action sequence (robot control)

## Textbook Structure

This living textbook covers the complete VLA pipeline across 8 chapters:

0. **Foundations** - Core concepts and problem formulation
1. **Architectures** - Model designs and network topologies
2. **Data** - Dataset construction and curation strategies
3. **Training** - Optimization and fine-tuning methods
4. **Evaluation** - Metrics and benchmarking protocols
5. **Deployment** - Production systems and scaling
6. **Applications** - Real-world use cases and case studies
7. **Future Directions** - Open problems and research frontiers

Each chapter builds on rigorous validation principles and real-world deployment constraints.
