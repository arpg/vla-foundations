# Chapter 1: Architectures

## Core Questions

- How do we tokenize continuous physical space?
- What makes a good latent space for robotic control?
- How do we align vision, language, and action modalities?

## Topics

### 1.1 Scene Encoders
- Vision transformers for spatial understanding
- Depth integration and 3D representations
- Temporal encoding for dynamic scenes

### 1.2 Multi-Modal Alignment
- Contrastive learning for vision-language
- Action space grounding
- The embedding geometry problem

### 1.3 Tokenization Strategies
- Discrete vs. continuous representations
- Spatial vs. semantic tokens
- Compression-fidelity trade-offs
