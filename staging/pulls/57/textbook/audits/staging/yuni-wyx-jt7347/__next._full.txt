8d:T4c3,However, there are still a few things left unanswered.
While ViNT is strongly generalizable in its pure navigational capabilities, it lacks more semantic reasoning behind choosing the specific trajectory along a certain path.
While it has a form of handling exploration versus exploitation (by diffusion generation of subgoals and subgoal ranking), it doesn't explicitly have an inherent understanding of the environment it's navigating in.
This extends to other contextual reasoning points, such as traversability (we can choose shortest set of nodes or actions in the graph, but what about the specific quality of the trajectories themselves?).
The model itself serves as a strong baseline as a foundation model for robot-vision navigation tasks, but still requires more components to push it outside of the realm of just adding more training data.
On that note also, ViNT seems to be pretty computationally expensive (training, diffusion generation).
As mentioned in the paper, ViNT requires a "degree of structural similarity" - it is mostly geared towards 2D or planar movement, and focuses mostly on RGB images.
Regardless, the ViNT framework is an important step towards generalization of robot navigation tasks.1f:["$","p",null,{"children":"$8d"}]

bb:T4ac,In comparison to ViNT, NoMaD presents a new approach to learning exploration and goal-seeking behaviors.
Instead of relying on a hierarchical graph-based approach, it's simply done by masking the goal during training and inference time to push the robot's adaptability to both scenarios.
The main contribution is architecturally quite simple, but effective.
The goal-masking effectively turns navigation from a single-task problem into a conditional behavior spectrum, allowing for a more unified end-to-end approach.
Additionally, the way they used diffusion for only action generation instead of image generation greatly reduces computational costs for running NoMaD.
Previously in ViNT, exploration versus exploitation was a behavior encoded within the graph generation and subgoal ranking.
Now with NoMaD, the low level collision avoidance and high level planning (exploration versus subgoal seeking) is defined in one model architecture.
Additionally, the probability distribution allows for more fine-tuned assignment of what actions are good and bad in all action space (e.g. high probability on turn left or turn right at a T junction, low probability of going straight and hitting wall).4f:["$","p",null,{"children":"$bb"}]
